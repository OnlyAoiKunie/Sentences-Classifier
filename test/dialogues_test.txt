What's the charge ? __eou__ You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate . __eou__ How long will it take ? __eou__ About 20 to 30 minutes . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps . __eou__ I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . __eou__ Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ? __eou__ He is really outrageous . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . __eou__ What ? He can't do this to you . __eou__ Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I shouted it back of course . __eou__ Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? __eou__ What would you do if you were in my shoes ? __eou__ Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . __eou__ No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . __eou__ I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . __eou__ I am too angry to do that . __eou__
Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams . __eou__ Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ? __eou__ I want a dog .

I will do it all by myself . __eou__ Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ? __eou__ Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already . __eou__ Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this . __eou__
Where are you going , Tony ? __eou__ It's none of your business . __eou__ Mom said you couldn't go out . __eou__ I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . __eou__
Dad , do you know where Mom is ? __eou__ I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . __eou__ She'd better not start crying like she usually does . __eou__ I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? __eou__ Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me . __eou__ I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . __eou__ That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . __eou__ We have great confidence in you . __eou__

My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ? __eou__ Yes .

I have an excuse to get to bed on time . __eou__ You like going to bed early ? __eou__ I don't like being too tired the next day . __eou__ Well , I still hate having a curfew . __eou__ If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . __eou__
Peter , it's time to get up . __eou__ Ten more minutes , mom . __eou__ What time is it now ? __eou__ It's already 3 8 o'clock . __eou__ Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school . __eou__

Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . __eou__ Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . __eou__ I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . __eou__ Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . __eou__ Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? __eou__ Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? __eou__ History . __eou__ Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . __eou__ Thirty percent ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? __eou__ Yes . It's an excellent system . __eou__ Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? __eou__ Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing . __eou__ I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . __eou__ I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . __eou__ What ? Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But nobody uses Macintosh ! __eou__ That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? __eou__ Yes , I'm from Taiwan . __eou__ Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . __eou__ But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . __eou__ There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . __eou__ Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . __eou__ No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . __eou__ Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . __eou__ You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . __eou__

I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . __eou__ Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . __eou__ Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . __eou__ The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . __eou__
I think Yoga might be suitable for me . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . __eou__ But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . __eou__ I don't know .

In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . __eou__ You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__ Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__ A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , " When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . " __eou__ It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ' __eou__

I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? __eou__ It's simple . You can use call transfer . __eou__ Is it so simple ? __eou__ Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . __eou__ It's true . __eou__ Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . __eou__ That's all ? __eou__ In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . __eou__

I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . __eou__ With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__ My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__ Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? __eou__ Does that make any difference ? __eou__ Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ Are they designed differently ? __eou__ A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . __eou__
What is my ideal weight ? __eou__ It depends on your height and body type . __eou__ How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ? __eou__ By warming up before and cooling down after your workout . __eou__ Sir , tell us about your experience with Super Bulk-up . __eou__ Well , it's completely changed my life . __eou__ Tell us how . __eou__ Well , before , I was the skinniest guy on the beach . __eou__ And now ? __eou__ Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . __eou__ Wow ! All because of Super Bulk-Up . __eou__

It pinches my toes . __eou__ I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in . __eou__ I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . __eou__ Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__
Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . __eou__ Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? __eou__ Uh , no .

It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ How about drinking soda ? __eou__ Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . __eou__ That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ How do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! __eou__

It ’ s her who should apologize . __eou__

Do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? __eou__ No , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something .

Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! __eou__ I know they aren't good for you , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty . __eou__ I recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? __eou__ Yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ? __eou__ I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! __eou__ What do we do first ? __eou__ first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . __eou__ Ok .

Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? __eou__ White rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me ! __eou__
I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I said , ' Do you need any help ? ' __eou__ That's very nice of you . I guess I could use some help . __eou__ Just tell me what you'd like me to do . __eou__

We set up the new alarm system a few months ago . __eou__ Who will take responsibility for the heating system if it has a problem ? __eou__ Of course we do . It is the landlord ’ s responsibility . __eou__ Are smoke detectors provided ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__

My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . __eou__ We have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . __eou__ Posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . __eou__ Yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . __eou__ How much do they cost ? __eou__ The prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask .

It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park . __eou__ Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . __eou__ Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite . __eou__ That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . __eou__ Look at the flowers over there . What are they ? __eou__ They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ? __eou__ They are . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park . __eou__ I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond . __eou__ If you come to the park in the morning , you can find squirrels running on the lawn . __eou__ It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover . __eou__ Well , off we go . I am sure we can have a great time . __eou__
Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ The dress is made on your measurement . __eou__ It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I will like it better . __eou__ OK , maybe you can try this one on . It's yellow . __eou__
Could I be of any help to you ? __eou__ I want to buy a skirt , but I have no idea which one to buy . __eou__ Do you like miniskirt ? It's popular among young girls . The pleated skirt also sells well . __eou__ I don't like to keep up with joneses . __eou__ What about the divided skirt ? __eou__ I think this suits me . Can I try it on ? __eou__
I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! __eou__ Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! __eou__ At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . __eou__ I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__ Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__ I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__ Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__ But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__ Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . __eou__
Hi , is you , John ? __eou__ Oh , Jane . What on earth have you been ? I've called you a thousand times . __eou__ Sorry , John . I suddenly got a severe stomachache last night , and stayed in hospital the whole day . __eou__ But I called your cell phone , and there was no answer . __eou__ I know , I left it at home . __eou__ Do you feel better now ? __eou__ It's OK now . Don't worry , John . __eou__
Do you want to buy a sweater ? __eou__ Yes . Which one is the latest ? __eou__ The cowl-neck pullovers are new in . It sells like hot cakes . __eou__ It's my style . Will it be resistance to balling ? __eou__ Of course . The brand is Bird and it's famous for its quality . __eou__
This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture . __eou__ I had planned to . I can bring some from my place . And there's some more at my parents ' . __eou__ Do you have a bed ? __eou__ Of course , I have . There is one in my old house . And I have another one from college at my parents ' house . __eou__ That's good . You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room . __eou__ Yeah , it is a good idea . You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to . __eou__ Yeah . By the way , can I take a shower ? __eou__ Sure , but I don't have hot water , yet . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ No , they're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . My phone should be working then , too . __eou__ Well , do you want to go outside for dinner ? __eou__ Yeah , I can't cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . Let's go to the restaurant nearby . It's my treat . __eou__ OK . Let's go . __eou__
( Having lunch with Joseph ) Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? __eou__ Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . __eou__ As far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? __eou__ To begin with , I have to use chopsticks . __eou__ But you look quite proficient in using them now . __eou__ Certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table . __eou__ Yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm in China . Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow ! __eou__ Anything strange about that ? __eou__ Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . __eou__ Oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . __eou__
Oh , look at those earrings , Maria . They're perfect for you . __eou__ These red ones ? I'm not sure . __eou__ No , the yellow ones . __eou__ Oh , these ? Hmm ...

That's expensive ! __eou__ Hey , let me get it for you . It's your birthday present . __eou__

He showed me one that he really liked . __eou__ I bet you had to drag him away . __eou__ He wanted to take it home yesterday . __eou__ I wonder what he'll name it . __eou__
I'm going to the bank . __eou__ What do you need to do ? __eou__ I need to withdraw some money . __eou__ How are you going to do that ? __eou__ I'll just use the ATM . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's the Automatic Teller Machine . __eou__ It gives you money ? __eou__ I just insert my debit card into the machine . __eou__ And it gives you money ? __eou__ Well , it gives me money , but it's my own money . __eou__ Oh . What good is that ? I thought it gave you free money . __eou__
Hey ! Are you getting dressed ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Why ? What time is it ? __eou__ It's a quarter to eight . I'm going to work . __eou__ But it's Saturday ! ! __eou__ I'm working on Saturday mornings this month.Are you getting up ? __eou__ No , I'm not . I'm staying in bed . __eou__ OK . See you at noon . __eou__ If I'm awake . __eou__
Can you help me , please ? Is there a public restroom near here ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I don't think so . __eou__ Oh , no ! ! My son needs a bathroom . __eou__ Well , there's a department store on Grant Street . There are restrooms in the basement . __eou__ Where on Grant Street ? __eou__ Between Second and Third Streets . The store is across from the hotel . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
I'm going to take a nap . __eou__ You should unplug the phone . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ Do you want me to wake you in an hour ? __eou__ No , thanks . Just let me sleep until I wake up . __eou__ I'll start dinner at 6:00 . __eou__ Okay . I think I'll be awake by then . __eou__ If not , your nose will wake you up . __eou__ You mean I will smell the food cooking ? __eou__ You might even dream about dinner . __eou__ I don't think I'm going to dream about anything . I'm really tired . __eou__ Have a nice nap . __eou__
What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? __eou__ We usually eat chicken , pork and beef . You eat these meats a lot in your country too , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , we do . We also eat mutton . __eou__ I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops . __eou__ That's right . Mutton chops taste so good . We eat them with sauce . Have you ever tried ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I tried once when I visited your country last year . I think they were very tasty . Can you cook them ? __eou__ Certainly I can . I'll buy some from the butcher's and cook for you next Sunday . __eou__ That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then . __eou__
Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it . __eou__ No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged . __eou__ But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride . __eou__ I know . I will pay attention to such a thing next time . __eou__
Excuse me . I'm your new neighbor , Jack . I just moved in . __eou__ Oh . Yes ? __eou__ I'm looking for a grocery store . Are there any around here ? __eou__ Yes , there are some on Pine Street . __eou__ OK . And is there a laundromat near here ? __eou__ Well , I think there's one across from the shopping center . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too . __eou__ A barber shop ? ! __eou__
Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class . __eou__ Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . __eou__ Yes , Mum . __eou__
Do you like the cookies ? __eou__ I finished them in no time . __eou__ Glad you like it . __eou__ Mum , when will we have them again ? __eou__
What's your weight . __eou__ 150 pounds . __eou__ Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . __eou__ I can't bear eating less . __eou__
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? __eou__ I attend an aerobic class three times a week . __eou__ Aren't you tired ? __eou__ No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . __eou__
In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . __eou__ Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! __eou__ Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . __eou__ Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . __eou__ Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . __eou__ What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . __eou__ Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . __eou__
What reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__ I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__ I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__ And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__ Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__ Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! __eou__
How can we avoid the jam ? __eou__ Let's take a roundabout way . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Look , traffic jam again ! __eou__
John , it ’ s time to get up . __eou__ It can ’ t be time to get up yet . __eou__ It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . __eou__ What ’ s the time ? __eou__ It ’ s nearly half past seven . __eou__ My watch says ten past . __eou__ It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . __eou__ Are you sure half past seven ? __eou__ Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . __eou__ ( And here is the seven o ’ clock news ) It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . __eou__ I could have stayed in bed for another half hour . __eou__
Shit , so crowded ! __eou__ The radio said it's OK on this road . __eou__ Things change every minute . __eou__ We have too many cars ! __eou__
Do you like shopping ? __eou__ Yeah . I go shopping once a week __eou__ Why don't you do your shopping at home ? __eou__ What do you mean ? I can't understand . __eou__ I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce . __eou__ Really ? That's unbelievable . __eou__
I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen . __eou__ high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . __eou__ It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . __eou__ What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? __eou__ It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . __eou__ It's a bit small but looks nice . __eou__ What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . __eou__
My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? __eou__ An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ? __eou__ Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . __eou__ Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . __eou__ That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__ That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__ Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . __eou__ That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? __eou__ 256MB . __eou__ Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . __eou__
I can't believe that . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . __eou__ Oh . Why did she do that ? __eou__ The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car . __eou__
Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? __eou__ Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . __eou__ Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ?

I think you'd like it . __eou__ It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__ I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . __eou__ Really ? that's interesting ! __eou__ Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode .

I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other . __eou__ How many bathrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__ I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__ How would you decorate your house ? __eou__ I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets . __eou__ How many TVs would your dream home have ? __eou__ I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . __eou__

Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__ Haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__ Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__ Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . __eou__ I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . __eou__ Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time . __eou__

Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . __eou__ I'm OK . __eou__ OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? __eou__ OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . __eou__ OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! __eou__ First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ Oh , OK . Wow ! __eou__ OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__ Wow . That sounds really good . __eou__ Mm , it is . __eou__ Wow . What fillings do you recommend ? __eou__ Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese . __eou__
Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box . __eou__ I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ? __eou__ I think you are flicking through it . __eou__ Well , wait a minute . __eou__

I'd like to be able to get around a little more . __eou__ But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . __eou__ But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? __eou__ A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . __eou__

Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ? __eou__ Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . __eou__ Good , you can make your dream come true here . __eou__ Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House . __eou__ So you can prove you are a man . __eou__ Bingo ! __eou__ It's just you ! __eou__

I gotta call mine too . __eou__

Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ? __eou__ Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . __eou__ Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks . __eou__ Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ? __eou__ Can you recommend some must-try ? __eou__ OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao . __eou__ What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny ! __eou__ Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun . __eou__ Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert . __eou__ Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings . __eou__ I ’ d like to try the salty ones .

Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? __eou__ Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife . __eou__ Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . __eou__ Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . __eou__ Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ? __eou__ Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant . __eou__ Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? __eou__ You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . __eou__ I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ? __eou__ There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget . __eou__ Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too . __eou__ It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ? __eou__ I'll take care of the order . __eou__ OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine .

Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . __eou__ You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . __eou__ Are you serious ? How can that be ? __eou__ Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . __eou__ Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it . __eou__ That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! __eou__ Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! __eou__ You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . __eou__ Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? __eou__ Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . __eou__ What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . __eou__ Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it . __eou__ Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week . __eou__ Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often . __eou__ Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price . __eou__
What did the boss say ? __eou__ He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? __eou__ You are still student so I don't think you should have time for that . __eou__ Don't worry about that . He said I can do that at spare time . Anyway , it's just a part-time job . __eou__ Okay , then . What kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ? __eou__ It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English . So I need to be here only on Sunday . __eou__ Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers . __eou__ That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences . __eou__ And a good way to get some pocket money . __eou__ Let's do it together . __eou__ I'll say yes . Wait a minute . I need an IC card . __eou__ For what ? You have a telephone at home , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive . __eou__
That was really a nightmare ! __eou__ Honey , what's up ? __eou__ I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . __eou__ Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? __eou__ I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . __eou__ Did you panic at the time ? __eou__ A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there . __eou__ Was there anyone else with you ? __eou__ Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying . __eou__ So you mean that you were the only brave one there ? __eou__ Yes . I have to call the property management . __eou__ For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ? __eou__ Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . __eou__ That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on . __eou__ I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience . __eou__
Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? __eou__ Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . __eou__ Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . __eou__ That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . __eou__ What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . __eou__ So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . __eou__ Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . __eou__ After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . __eou__

You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest . __eou__ What about a two-bedroom house ? __eou__ A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB . __eou__ I see . __eou__ I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family . __eou__ Okay , I will take it into consideration . __eou__

' __eou__ It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . __eou__ Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! __eou__ Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! __eou__ A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! __eou__ The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! __eou__ Great play ! __eou__ We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! __eou__ Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! __eou__

Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__ Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . __eou__ All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! __eou__ Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__ Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__ It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__ Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! __eou__
Excuse me ? How can I get to the nearest branch of the national bank ? __eou__ There ’ s branch on new street . Walk up this street until you get to the first set of traffic lights .

Then ? __eou__ Then keep walking until you reach the war memorial . It ’ s a big statue of a soldier . You can ’ t miss it . __eou__ Ok . Where do I go then ? __eou__ You ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial . It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building . __eou__ God it . Thans very much . __eou__
Do you often buy magazines ? __eou__ I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? __eou__ Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . __eou__ Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? __eou__ Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . __eou__ Do you have a subscription ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? __eou__ I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . __eou__
What game do you like ? __eou__ I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts . __eou__ I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated . __eou__ It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn . __eou__ I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ? __eou__ I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money . __eou__ Do you play bridge ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . __eou__ I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ? __eou__ Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game . __eou__ I ’ ll call my friend now . you call yours . __eou__
Do you like cooking ? __eou__ I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ? __eou__ I don ’ t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . __eou__ You can ask the guests to help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . __eou__ So , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . __eou__ Italian , Indian , and Chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice . __eou__ Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? __eou__ Not at all . You can find most of them at supermarket . The ingredients are usually the same as in western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . __eou__ How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ? __eou__ Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours . __eou__
Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? __eou__ Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ? __eou__ No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? __eou__ Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . __eou__ I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . __eou__ So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . __eou__ Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something . __eou__ Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting . __eou__ Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine . __eou__

We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds . __eou__ Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ? __eou__ We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant . __eou__ I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often . __eou__ Why is it relatively expensive ? __eou__ Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries . __eou__ I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country . __eou__ We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . __eou__ Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . __eou__ A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . __eou__

You ’ ll simply have to purchase another ticket . __eou__ How much is that going to cost me ? __eou__ It depends on how you want to travel . If you want a soft sleeper , it will cost 610 RIB , if you want a hard seat , it will only cost 100RMB . __eou__ I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours ! __eou__ looks like you might like the soft sleeper then . __eou__ Yes , fine . Let me see how much money I have in my wallet . __eou__ ... sir ? __eou__ Where ’ s my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! __eou__ Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket . __eou__ You ’ re right .

I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . __eou__ Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . __eou__ Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . __eou__
Come on ! It's time to go ! __eou__ Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? __eou__ Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . __eou__ That won't take long . __eou__ Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . __eou__ Well , I'm not quite ready . __eou__ I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! __eou__ You wouldn't do a thing like that ! __eou__ Oh , yes , I would ! __eou__
Your house is very old . Does it need redecorating ? __eou__ Yes , it really needs redecorating . __eou__ Shall I help you with it ? __eou__ I don ’ t suppose you could . __eou__ I have much time . I suppose it can be done . __eou__ I ’ ll be glad if you would . __eou__
Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ? __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__ Look ! The iron is still on . __eou__ I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now . __eou__ Look at my nice blue shirt , there ’ s a big hole in it . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , Jim . __eou__ Never mind , dear . __eou__
OK .

It ’ s time now . __eou__ Mam , another minute , could I ? __eou__ Hurry up , little boy . __eou__
So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . __eou__ That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . __eou__ Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . __eou__ Did you buy new cupboards too ? __eou__ No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . __eou__ I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . __eou__ Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . __eou__ Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . __eou__ Both kinds of food are becoming popular . Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . __eou__ I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! __eou__
I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ? __eou__ Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . __eou__ I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . __eou__ The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . __eou__ Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . __eou__ It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . __eou__ Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine . __eou__ The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . __eou__ Yes , everything has been well designed . __eou__
I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t . __eou__ I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . __eou__ Perhaps you left that at school . __eou__ No , I had it when I left school this afternoon . __eou__ Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . __eou__ Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . __eou__ But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . __eou__ Perhaps I should call her later . __eou__
There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . __eou__ Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . __eou__ I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound . __eou__ Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . __eou__ That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . __eou__ Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration . __eou__
How beautiful the flower is ! __eou__ Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__ You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . __eou__ You mustn't pick it in this place . __eou__ Where it is ? __eou__ It's a private garden . __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__ Yeah , Please do . Now let me show you the house . __eou__ This seems a pretty nice room , I should say . __eou__ You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . __eou__ What about the kitchen ? __eou__ It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen . The stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is OK , too . __eou__ I see . I'd like to live here for about three years . __eou__ Terrific ! When are you moving in ? __eou__ Next Saturday at the earliest . __eou__
I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool . __eou__ Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? __eou__ I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . __eou__ I see , sir . For a gentleman of your size I would recommend a single-breasted jacket as it does tend to make one look a little slimmer . Just let me take your measurements , Let's see , neck 41cm , chest 110cm , wait 120cm and inside leg 70cm . You do have short legs , sir . __eou__ Yes , that is why I usually choose dark colours for my business suits . __eou__ Can you come back in three days for a fitting ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting . __eou__
Where is that ? __eou__ Take me to the airport , please . __eou__ Are you in a hurry ? __eou__ I have to be there before 17 o'clock . __eou__ We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour . __eou__ There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time . __eou__ I'll do my best . __eou__ Here's twenty dollars . __eou__ Do you have small bills ? __eou__ No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ? __eou__ Here is your receipt . Thank you . __eou__

What size are you ? __eou__ Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen . __eou__ Here you are , madam . All these are sixteens . __eou__ I quite like this one . How much is it ? __eou__ It's $ 180 . __eou__ Oh , that's too expensive . Aren't there any cheaper ones ? __eou__ These are our cheapest coats , madam . __eou__ Yes , I see . I'll take it . Here's $ 200 . __eou__ Here's your change . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I'm looking for a pair of shoes . __eou__ What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . __eou__ I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice .

I'd like to send this parcel to Spain , please . __eou__ Do you want to send it by airmail or by surface mail ? __eou__ Well , how long will it take if I send it by surface mail ? __eou__ About five weeks . __eou__ Oh , dear . It won't get there for New Year's Day if I send it by surface mail . How much will it cost if I send it by air ? __eou__ Just a moment . I'll weigh it . __eou__
Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? __eou__ Yes , they all stop at this corner . __eou__ I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ? __eou__ You can take any bus except the Number 9 . __eou__ How often do the buses run ? __eou__ They run about every five minutes . __eou__ Fine .

Can you help me find a pan ? __eou__ Are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ? __eou__ I want a big pan . __eou__ Does this one look big enough ? __eou__ Yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much . __eou__ Well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ? __eou__ It's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking . __eou__ Here's the same pan , but it has a space-age , heat-resistant plastic handle . __eou__ Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . __eou__ I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ? __eou__ Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ? __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . Here's the lid . Yes , it comes with the pan . __eou__
Mom , I'm ready for school . __eou__ Let me feel your forehead . I'm so glad it wasn't strep throat . __eou__ I don't have a fever , and I'm ready for my test . __eou__ But I'm not sure you're strong enough yet . Here's some seafood rice soup I made . It's delicious . __eou__ I'm fine , Mom . I feel so much better . I want to go to school . I'm missing out on all the fun . __eou__ But the last two days were a weekend . __eou__ Let me go to school , please ! I'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick ! __eou__
Johnny , I want to thank you . __eou__ What do you mean , Mom ? For breaking your best china ? __eou__ Oh , Johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . No , I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy . __eou__ Well , it's more like she kept me busy ... __eou__ I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you . __eou__ Am I back in your good books ? __eou__ Not only that , but I'm going to buy you that video game after all ! __eou__
Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids . __eou__ Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? __eou__ Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out . __eou__ That's the beauty of it , and the danger . __eou__ I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera . __eou__ How much ? __eou__ Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months . __eou__ Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck . __eou__
My latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month . __eou__ And this espresso looks like ... oil ! __eou__ It still tastes fine , though . __eou__ These days , I can't think of anything but motor oil . Even coffee makes me think of it . __eou__ Wait a second ! There's the idea for this case ! “ Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ” __eou__
Balista , I'll have a frappuccino . __eou__ What a girly drink . I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva ... __eou__ You and your fancy Italian names . __eou__ Isn't “ frappuccino ” Italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini . __eou__ I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much . __eou__ And I'll stick with real coffee . __eou__
So the apartment comes unfurnished ? __eou__ This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture . __eou__ We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners . __eou__ This building is only four years old . It was built with central air . __eou__ Just like in the States ! That's perfect ! __eou__ And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer . Come and see . __eou__
See ? That wasn't so bad . __eou__ Easy for you to say . My bottom still stings . __eou__ It might be sore for a while . You'll be OK . Now let's go home and rest . __eou__ Can't we go to McDonald's first ? __eou__ No , sweetie . I'll make you some tomato soup and rice . __eou__ No , thanks . __eou__ And vegetables with porridge . __eou__ Blah ... What's that ? __eou__ This is all your medicine . You need to take it four times a day for three days straight . __eou__
Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? __eou__ I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . __eou__ I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! __eou__ I'm doing my best , Grandma ... __eou__ Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! __eou__ Uh-oh , here we go ... __eou__
Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome ! __eou__ It's more violent than TV news ! __eou__ What time is it anyway ? __eou__ Nine-thirty . __eou__ Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done ! __eou__ No time . That's their headlights in the window ! __eou__ OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ... __eou__ Little dude , your life is over ! __eou__ No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence . __eou__
Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . __eou__ You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . __eou__ Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! __eou__
I found it at a garage sale once . __eou__ What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? __eou__ Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . __eou__ Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks . __eou__ Sixty bucks ? No-can-do , son . You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five . __eou__ Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later ... __eou__
Why didn't you text me last night ? __eou__ What ? I sent you three or four messages ! __eou__ I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message . __eou__ Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . __eou__ Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month . __eou__ I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ? __eou__ I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . __eou__ No wonder you didn't get my texts ! __eou__
What's for dinner ? __eou__ Leftovers . __eou__ What ? Leftovers of what and from when ? __eou__ From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! __eou__ Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ? __eou__ Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius . __eou__ Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning . __eou__ Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! __eou__
What did you cook ? __eou__ Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . __eou__ Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ? __eou__ Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good ! __eou__ This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! __eou__ Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . __eou__ This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday ! __eou__ Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! __eou__ Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious ! __eou__ Want some more ? __eou__ I'm stuffed ! __eou__
Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ? __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems . __eou__ Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? __eou__ We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight . __eou__ What's my other option ? __eou__ Well , If you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning . __eou__ That's fine . I'll do that then . __eou__ Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now . __eou__
Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain ! __eou__ Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty . __eou__ But you could have saved money . __eou__ From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought ! __eou__ F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ... __eou__ Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now ! __eou__
Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here . __eou__ Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA . __eou__ Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ? __eou__ OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food . __eou__ You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes . __eou__ Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good ! __eou__
I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden ! __eou__ What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening ! __eou__ On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject . __eou__ Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? __eou__ Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . __eou__ What type of tools ? __eou__ You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . __eou__ Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? __eou__ I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! __eou__ Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! __eou__

What else do you have ? __eou__ Well , I also have ... __eou__
Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce . __eou__ You might want to try the mangoes . __eou__ Can you describe a mango to me ? __eou__ It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it . __eou__ Do I eat the seed ? __eou__ Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years . __eou__ What's the price of these mangoes ? __eou__ Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each . __eou__ Tell me what they taste like . __eou__ Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet . __eou__ Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ? __eou__ Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat . __eou__ Where do mangoes come from ? __eou__ These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India . __eou__
I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . __eou__ Well , we just got in some mangoes . __eou__ Mangoes .

Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Marry . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening . It will be warm and humid all weekend . In the Midwest , expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees . __eou__ That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast . Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding , especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls . __eou__ That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . __eou__ It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather , but at least the sun will come out . I advise weekend travelers to be careful , especially while driving . Back to you , Mark . __eou__ Thanks John , and there you have it ! Looks like it ’ s a weekend to stay at home ! __eou__
Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ? __eou__ Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement . __eou__ Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , please sit down . Coffee ? __eou__ No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine . __eou__ Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix .

Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? __eou__ yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . __eou__ true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . __eou__ yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining .

Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether w __eou__ that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . __eou__ I understand .

Do you think children watch too much tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing .

It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . __eou__ So , you ’ re online eight hours a day . __eou__ Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . __eou__ How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? __eou__ I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . __eou__ How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? __eou__ What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . __eou__

So can you fix it ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . __eou__ What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! __eou__ Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! __eou__ OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? __eou__ Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . __eou__ I have no idea what you are talking about .

If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! __eou__
Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan . __eou__ I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US . it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network . __eou__ What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone . __eou__ Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free . __eou__ Really ?

Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! __eou__ Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? __eou__ I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day !

Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . __eou__ I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! __eou__ But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet , I have no idea how I could have picked a virus . __eou__ Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly.yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . __eou__ Ok . Anything else ? __eou__ Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! __eou__ Um yeah.Sorry about that . __eou__
Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . __eou__ Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? __eou__ Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__ I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . __eou__ But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . __eou__ Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . __eou__ Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . __eou__

I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from . __eou__ I would like to rent a car with a good stereo . __eou__ All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us . __eou__ Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time . __eou__ Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot . __eou__ This is a Porsche ! __eou__ Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive . __eou__ Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars . __eou__ But how can you do that ? __eou__ It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it almost looks new . __eou__
Ah ! No ! Damn it ! __eou__ It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . __eou__ So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . __eou__ Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? __eou__ No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . __eou__ I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . __eou__ I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . __eou__ What are we going to do now ? __eou__ I don't know . I feel like going out . __eou__ I wonder how much of the city is down . __eou__ It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . __eou__ Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . __eou__ Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . __eou__ I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . __eou__ Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? __eou__ I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . __eou__ Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? __eou__ No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will . __eou__ So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? __eou__ How many students are in the class ? __eou__ About fourteen . __eou__ So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry . __eou__ Damn ! __eou__
May I have a look at that vase , please ? __eou__ Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . __eou__ Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . __eou__ Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? __eou__
I'd like you to do me a favor . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Can you mail this at the post office for me ?

And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's . __eou__
Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ? __eou__ Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know . __eou__ What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ? __eou__ No , I ’ m afraid not . __eou__ Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first . __eou__ Sorry . __eou__ It ’ s all right . Where are you going ? __eou__ I wanted to see the White House . __eou__ Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A . __eou__ Oh , well thank you very much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
How are the children doing in your class , Jane ? __eou__ They ’ re all doing fine .

As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . __eou__ can you train a rabbit to do things ? __eou__ you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . __eou__ that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? __eou__ not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people . __eou__
I want to buy some running shoes . Maybe New Balance . __eou__ Why do you need running shoes ? You aren't a runner . __eou__ But I exercise at the club .

And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious .

I can even spend 100 dollars on them . I don't care . __eou__ But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money . __eou__ My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive . And they look cool too . __eou__ Well , do what you like.There are different kinds of New Balance shoes though.You don't have to buy the most expensive . __eou__ I want the best.My sister said good shoes are very important . For support . They support your feet . __eou__ Your sister is a fitness expert , huh ? __eou__ No , but she exercises more than me . __eou__ I really think you are stubborn about some things.But here .

That's expensive . __eou__ What you're paying for , Ma'am , are the ingredients.It is a very high quality product . __eou__ I understand . I need some mascara too.Do you have a good thickening mascara ? __eou__ Of course . Here is our thickening mascara.We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . __eou__ Alright .

Where ’ s Sally , Jack ? __eou__ She ’ s in the garden , Jane . __eou__ What ’ s she doing ? __eou__ She ’ s sitting under the tree . __eou__ Is Tim in the garden , too ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He ’ s climbing the tree . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree . __eou__ Tim is . __eou__ What about the dog ? __eou__ The dog ’ s in the garden , too . It ’ s running across the grass . It ’ s running after a cat . __eou__
Do you have any shoes like these ? __eou__ What size ? __eou__ Size five . __eou__ What colour ? __eou__ Black . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We don't haven any . __eou__ But my sister bought this pair last month . __eou__ Did she buy them here ? __eou__ No , she bought them in the U . S . __eou__ We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now . __eou__ Can you get a pair for me please ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ’ re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now . __eou__ They look very uncomfortable . __eou__ They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes ! __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . __eou__ Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . __eou__ I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . __eou__ Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . __eou__ Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? __eou__ Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? __eou__ History . __eou__ Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your __eou__ Thirty percent ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? __eou__ Yes . It's an excellent system . __eou__ Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? __eou__ Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . __eou__ I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . __eou__ I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . __eou__ What ? Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But nobody uses Macintosh ! __eou__ That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma __eou__ Yes , I'm from Taiwan . __eou__ Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . __eou__ But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . __eou__ There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple . __eou__ Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . __eou__ No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . __eou__ Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . __eou__ You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I would like to return these slacks . __eou__ Alright . Do you have your receipt ? __eou__ Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week . __eou__ And why are you returning them ? __eou__ I bought them to go with a blouse of mine . But they don't really match . __eou__ I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . __eou__ Yes , they were thirty percent off . __eou__ I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . __eou__ I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before . __eou__ I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . __eou__ I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here.Can you make an exception this time ? __eou__ Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment.Ma ' am , the manager says I can do it this time . __eou__ Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me . __eou__ Please show me your receipt again . __eou__ Here it is . __eou__ I will have to give you store credit , Ma'am . If you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit . __eou__ Store credit is okay with me . I'm sure I will find something I like . I shop here a lot . __eou__ We appreciate your business , Ma'am . __eou__
are you ready for your first driving lesson ? __eou__ yes . Which one is the brake again ? __eou__ the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . __eou__ I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . __eou__ automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . __eou__ you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! __eou__ very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? __eou__ I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? __eou__ how ’ s that ? __eou__ that ’ s better . Now what ? __eou__ check your petrol situation . __eou__ the tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . __eou__ I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . __eou__ remember , no honking this time . The horn is only for emergencies ! __eou__ why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ? __eou__
Wow , Amy , look at that number . __eou__ What's so great about it ? __eou__ What do you mean ? It's a scrim . __eou__ Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that . __eou__ I love that kind of stuff . __eou__ Yeah , you seem to like those styles . __eou__ Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk . __eou__ This one looks really expensive though . __eou__ I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it . __eou__ Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke . __eou__ I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week . __eou__ Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary . __eou__ Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ? __eou__ Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit . __eou__
alright , tell me what you think . __eou__ don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? __eou__ yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? __eou__ that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? __eou__ no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . __eou__ I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? __eou__ that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__ thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__ yep . Here it is . What do you think ? __eou__ that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__ the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? __eou__ no , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . __eou__ that ’ s even better than the real thing . __eou__ if I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . __eou__ it ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! __eou__
ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ? __eou__ I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here . __eou__ what ? I don't understand . __eou__ I though you said you wanted to have Dutch food ? __eou__ Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' ! __eou__ Huh ? What were you talking about , then ? __eou__ ' going Dutch ' means to split the bill , silly ! __eou__ oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway ! __eou__
it ’ s such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ what kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__ I promise . We ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__ ok , let ’ s go then ! __eou__ do you have any money ? __eou__ for what ? __eou__ for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . __eou__ you said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__ I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! __eou__ I should have known ... __eou__
I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ? __eou__ sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ? __eou__ how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them . __eou__ dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! __eou__ well , what do you have in mind ? __eou__ how about the Mongolian hot pot ? __eou__ oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up ! __eou__ maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . __eou__ sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . __eou__ yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines . __eou__ great . Let's go ! __eou__ wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . __eou__
Are you a good driver ? __eou__ Yes , I'm rather good at driving . __eou__ I need you to teach me how to drive . __eou__ Yes , but do you have your learner's permit ? __eou__ Yes , I have it . __eou__ Have you ever driven a car before ? __eou__ I drove a car before , but only once . __eou__ Are you aware of all the controls in the car ? __eou__ I already know all of them . __eou__ When would you like me to start teaching you ? __eou__ When do you have time ? __eou__ Call me tomorrow , and we'll get started . __eou__
I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ I need help turning them on . __eou__ You need change . __eou__ The machines take change ? __eou__ Yes . It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer . __eou__ Where do i put the money in ? __eou__ You put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on . __eou__ That's it ? __eou__ There's nothing else to it . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else . __eou__
What are we going to eat for dinner ? __eou__ Whatever meal that you plan on making . __eou__ I thought you were making dinner tonight . __eou__ I do all the cooking . __eou__ Your food tastes so much better than mine . __eou__ Save it . If you want something to eat , then make it yourself . __eou__ You really want me to cook tonight ? __eou__ I had a long day today . I really am not in the mood to make anything . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Thanks . I'm going to go take a nap . __eou__ Would you like me to come get you when the food is done ? __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

I'm hungry too . __eou__ I'll be getting money on Friday , and I'll get it back to you then . __eou__ Okay , so on Friday , you can buy yourself something to eat . __eou__ That's not nice . __eou__ You can always go home and make something to eat . __eou__ I can't go home yet , because I have things to do here . __eou__ Sorry . That's not my fault . __eou__
I need a snack from the cafeteria . __eou__ What are you thinking of getting ? __eou__ I only want some chips . __eou__ I think I may get something too . __eou__ What do you plan on buying ? __eou__ I have a sweet tooth . I want candy . __eou__ What kind of candy do you want ? __eou__ I really want some chocolate . __eou__ What kind of chocolate do you want ? __eou__ I either want a Snickers or a Kit Kat . __eou__ The cafeteria doesn't sell Kit Kats . __eou__ Then I guess I'll just get a Snickers . __eou__
I want to make dinner tonight . __eou__ What are you thinking of making ? __eou__ I don't have any idea what to cook . __eou__ How about making a teriyaki bowl ? __eou__ Can you tell me how to make it ? __eou__ All it consists of is teriyaki beef and white rice . __eou__ Okay , but what do I have to do to prepare it ? __eou__ All you have to do is cook some white rice . __eou__ What do I do after that ? __eou__ Then cut up the beef and marinate it in teriyaki sauce . __eou__ What else do I have to do ? __eou__ All that's left is to cook it . __eou__
I really need to start eating healthier . __eou__ I have to start eating better too . __eou__ What kind of food do you usually eat ? __eou__ I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken . __eou__ Is that really all that you eat ? __eou__ That's basically it . __eou__ How do you stick to only those foods ? __eou__ Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you . __eou__ Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ? __eou__ I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat . __eou__ That does sound pretty good . __eou__ I know it does , and that's because it is . __eou__
I am starving . __eou__ Didn't you just eat ? __eou__ I'm still hungry . __eou__ We ate everything from dinner . __eou__ I just need a snack . __eou__ What are you going to make ? __eou__ I don't have the slightest clue . __eou__ Go make a sandwich . __eou__ I'm not sure what kind I want . __eou__ Why don't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ? __eou__ I think I will do that . __eou__ Maybe you should . __eou__
What's the side dish that you're making for dinner ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I was thinking of making a vegetable . __eou__ What kind of vegetable are you thinking about making ? __eou__ Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ? __eou__ Why don't you make some corn ? __eou__ How would you like the corn ? __eou__ I don't understand what you mean . __eou__ Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ? __eou__ Why don't you grill it ? __eou__ That's how you want it ? __eou__ Yeah , that sounds delicious . __eou__ Okay , I'll grill some corn then . __eou__

Don't do that again . __eou__
Do you wash clothes here often ? __eou__ I have been coming here for the past few years . __eou__ Why do you wash here ? __eou__ It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here . __eou__ I've only washed my clothes here a couple times . __eou__ Why don't you wash clothes at home ? __eou__ I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken . __eou__ Why don't you just get it fixed ? __eou__ I can't afford it . __eou__ So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ? __eou__ That's my only option right now . __eou__ Don't worry .

I'm having problems with my computer . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ For some reason it won't turn on . __eou__ Have you checked the connections on your computer ? __eou__ What connections ? __eou__ There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet . __eou__ Will the cords keep it from turning on ? __eou__ It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected . __eou__ I didn't think of that . __eou__ Try it and see if it works . __eou__ I think that I will , thanks . __eou__ It should work , but let me know if it doesn't . __eou__

Hopefully I won't have to call about him again . __eou__
I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . __eou__ I was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk . __eou__ Did they go with the proposed counter-offer ? __eou__ They want you to pick up the cost of the home inspection , but they accepted your offer . __eou__ Is a home inspection very expensive ? __eou__ It can cost between five hundred and one thousand dollars . __eou__ Do I get to choose who inspects the home ? __eou__ Yes , you get to choose .

By the way . you didn't tell me what you are studying here . __eou__ Didn't I ? I'm doing business studies . __eou__ Really ? That's great . You hope to join a company after graduating ? __eou__ Maybe . My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born . We are living in Toronto . Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate . It's too soon to say really . __eou__ What about your friend Zoe __eou__ She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy . __eou__ Accountancy ? Really ? She must be very good at figures . __eou__ I guess so . What about you , Simon ? __eou__ I'm studying law . __eou__ Great ! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer . __eou__ Sure , welcome anytime __eou__

Hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? __eou__ Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? __eou__ Sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . __eou__ Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! __eou__ Yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . __eou__ That ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? __eou__ Of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . __eou__ You mean you got working experience , right ? __eou__ Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . __eou__ It must be very demanding . __eou__ Sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . __eou__ Really ? It sounds interesting . __eou__ Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . __eou__ Great . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
Hi ! I'm Hong lei . What's your name ? __eou__ Hello , Hong Lei . My name's Ricky . __eou__ Hi Ricky . Are you a new student here ? __eou__ Yes , I had my first lesson this morning . Are you a new student too ? __eou__ No , I've been here for six months . __eou__ Six months . That's a long time . __eou__ It's not so long really . What class are you in ? Intermediate or ... ? __eou__ Intermediate Three . And what about you ? __eou__ I'm in Advanced One . Who's your teacher ? __eou__ I can't remember her name , but she's got curly red hair . __eou__ Ah ! Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ That's probably Anne Wallis . __eou__ Yes that's right . Do you know her ? Is she your teacher too ? __eou__ No . But she taught me last term . How long have you been here ? __eou__ Only a week . __eou__ Wow , not long . Where do you live ? With a family ? __eou__ Well , I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment .

Would you like her phone number ? __eou__ That would be great ! Thanks for your help . Can I buy you coffee ? __eou__
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__ Why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ Isn't there anything else ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ You must have a high IQ score . __eou__ Well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ My IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__ Seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__ Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ Well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ OK , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ Let's go ! __eou__
Are you ready ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Who can tell us something about the author's life ? Volunteer ? __eou__ The author was a famous writer , and he was also a politician . He was born in 1911 and died in 1985 . __eou__ Very good . Sit down , please . Susan , what's the general idea of the text ? __eou__ Can I answer it in Chinese ? __eou__ No , you can't . This is an English class , and you have to express yourself in English . __eou__ Let me have a try . The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . They are quiet , shy and reserved ... __eou__ Excellent . Class is over . Let's have a break . __eou__
Bill , I have received the admission letter from Cambridge University ! __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ How about you ? Have you got any news from university ? __eou__ No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it . __eou__ I am glad you can study something you really like ! __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ The reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . __eou__ Oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . __eou__ She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . __eou__ Is there someone else I can talk to ? __eou__ She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? __eou__ Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . __eou__ Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? __eou__ I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . __eou__ I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? __eou__ That will be fine . __eou__ Ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 then . See you then . __eou__
We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ? __eou__ But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? __eou__ After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . __eou__ How often do you meet ? __eou__ We plan to get together once a week . __eou__ What days , do you know ? __eou__ We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight . __eou__ Okay , count me in . __eou__
David , what's new with you ? You are not in the mood . Can you tell me ? __eou__ After six months , my college life will come to the end . The following trouble will be the job-hunting . That's really a headache . __eou__ Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . Maybe I should look on the bright side . __eou__
There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms . __eou__ What are those ? __eou__ They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons . __eou__ Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ? __eou__ Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . __eou__ I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache . __eou__
I'm so nervous about this oral test . __eou__ Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well . __eou__ I just want to get it over with . __eou__
The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? __eou__ Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ I am 100 % certain . __eou__ According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time . __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? __eou__ Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . __eou__ So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . __eou__ No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . __eou__ What if I don't know the title of the book ? __eou__ Well , you can look under the author's name . __eou__ Could you give me an example ? __eou__ Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . __eou__
Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ? __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ He had moved and held a party on July 1st . __eou__ It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time . __eou__ Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends . __eou__ You're right ! I will call him this weekend and meet him . __eou__
Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet ! __eou__ Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . __eou__ You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report . __eou__ Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . __eou__ It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . __eou__ You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . __eou__ I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade . __eou__ If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . __eou__
I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . __eou__ It's ok . What do you want to ask ? __eou__ Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? __eou__ The first place you should go is the International Center . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . __eou__ What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? __eou__ They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . __eou__ Can we get any more help at the International Center ? __eou__ Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . __eou__ I see . It must be worth going to . __eou__ Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . __eou__ Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . __eou__ It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . __eou__
Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? __eou__ I register this Friday . __eou__ What classes do you plan on taking ? __eou__ I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . __eou__ Is that class really that popular ? __eou__ Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . __eou__ What other classes are you going to take ? __eou__ I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . __eou__ I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . __eou__ Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . __eou__ I had Professor Mahoney . __eou__ Is he an easy grader ? __eou__ I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? __eou__ Not at all . I got a 3.8 . __eou__ Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? __eou__ I got a 4.0 in that class . __eou__ Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder . __eou__ It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . __eou__ Oh . That helps . Thanks . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? __eou__ These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . __eou__ Can I check this one out ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . __eou__ Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out . __eou__ All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ? __eou__ They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class . __eou__ Would you consider it your favorite class ? __eou__ I don't know if I would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there . __eou__ What class was your favorite then ? __eou__ I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific . __eou__ I never took that yet . If that was your favorite , I think I will check it out . __eou__
David , what do you want to do after graduation ? __eou__ I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? __eou__ That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . __eou__ It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . __eou__ You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . __eou__
Peter , which club do you want to join ? __eou__ I haven't decided yet . What about you , Andy ? __eou__ I am a member of the basketball club . Do you want to join us ? __eou__ But I don't know how to play basketball . __eou__ It's OK . Don't worry about it . Our school coach will train us to play basketball . __eou__
I failed the exam because I didn't study . __eou__ Serves you right . __eou__
What's this then ? __eou__ It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . __eou__ But this should have been handed in last Thursday . __eou__ Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__ My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . __eou__ Oh , Yes ? __eou__ It's true , sir . __eou__
May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . __eou__ I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . __eou__ I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . __eou__ Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . __eou__ Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . __eou__ Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . __eou__ But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? __eou__ What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . __eou__ Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . __eou__ Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . __eou__ Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . __eou__ I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . __eou__ You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . __eou__ I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . __eou__ You can count on me . __eou__
Excuse me , Miss . __eou__ Yes . May I help you ? __eou__ I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . __eou__ I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now . Could you come back about 3 thirty ? __eou__ Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon . __eou__ Good . See you later . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night . __eou__ I didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . Tell me about it . __eou__ Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills . __eou__ I really admire you for that . How is it going ? __eou__ It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know . __eou__
Hello . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I hope so . I would like to register for Comp Lit 287 . __eou__ I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system . __eou__ I know . I already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won't let me . __eou__ That's because it's full . __eou__ But I'm a new student here . I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class . I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office . __eou__ Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ? __eou__ My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G . __eou__ Alright . And what is your major ? __eou__ I'm a comparative literature major . __eou__ Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Why didn't you tell me ? I didn't know you were one of our students . __eou__ That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287 . I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it . __eou__ The university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . I can give you a special code.When you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class . __eou__ Even if the class is full ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ Oh , I didn't know that . __eou__ Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it . __eou__ Thank you . So you think I will be able to get in with this ? __eou__ Sure . Just call the touch-tone registration system again.Then , follow the directions on the sheet . You will get in no problem . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Next time you come in here , I will recognize you . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ? __eou__ Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . __eou__ Are you Chinese ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I like it so far . But my English still needs work . __eou__ I want to study Mandarin and international relations . __eou__ Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? __eou__ They teach regular characters . __eou__ I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . __eou__ You just said your English needs work , yes ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . __eou__ Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . __eou__ You mean you and I ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? __eou__ Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . __eou__ How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? __eou__ First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . __eou__ Would I help you with writing ? __eou__ No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes . __eou__ I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? __eou__ Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11 __eou__ Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1 __eou__ So if you want to meet at 10 __eou__ It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . __eou__ And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own . __eou__ Let me give you my phone number . __eou__ Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card . __eou__ Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute . __eou__ Do you know about the Bucky Card ? __eou__ I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it . __eou__ The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . __eou__ What about beer ? __eou__ The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee . __eou__ That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? __eou__ Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . __eou__ And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ? __eou__ This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money ! __eou__ Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs only 19 dollars a year for a card . __eou__ Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper . __eou__ But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year . __eou__ Yeah , maybe . Alright . Give me an application form . __eou__
The answer for number 6 is C , 7 is B , 8 is A ... __eou__ Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you . __eou__ Sure . 7 is B . Any others ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__
Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine . __eou__ Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading . __eou__ You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library . __eou__ Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet . __eou__ Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? __eou__ No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . __eou__ Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world . __eou__ I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages . __eou__ So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . __eou__
This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ? __eou__ I'd like to introduce myself first . __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__ My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends . __eou__
How many courses do you have for this semester ? __eou__ Eight altogether . __eou__ How are they proportioned ? __eou__ Six are compulsory , two optional . __eou__
Bill , your work is too messy . __eou__ I'll pay attention to my handwriting next time . __eou__ Is this a promise ? __eou__ Yes , I'm serious this time . __eou__
It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . __eou__ Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . __eou__ Which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? __eou__ Were I in your position , I ’ d go to America . __eou__ Which university should I apply to ? __eou__ There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . __eou__ Oh , I see . Thank you very much . __eou__
What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? __eou__ Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . __eou__ You are going to take courses ? __eou__ Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . __eou__ Sounds hard . __eou__ Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . __eou__ Won ’ t you get lonely ? __eou__ Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . __eou__
Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit ! __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Actually , I've never been anywhere with so many black people before . It's different . __eou__ Howard is eighty percent black . But there are whites , and even Asians here . Thankfully , it's also coed . __eou__ Great ! Is your , too ? __eou__ Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight . __eou__ That's a black fraternity , right ? So we should see some dancing ! __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? __eou__ Yes , I finished last Friday . __eou__ You sound relieved . __eou__ Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . __eou__ Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? __eou__ Yes , I intend to go to university . That'll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results . __eou__ You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? __eou__ Oh , yes . __eou__
Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ? __eou__ Because Myra was cheating on exams.and she spoke back rudely . __eou__ I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . __eou__
Hey , This is your order . __eou__ Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before . __eou__ Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? __eou__ Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . __eou__ Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? __eou__ No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . __eou__ Very nice . Thank you for your time . __eou__ Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . __eou__ OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . __eou__ Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? __eou__ OK . But I'd like some cookies . __eou__ Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . __eou__ I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . __eou__ Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . __eou__ It's OK . Thank you . __eou__
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ I guess I never thought of that before . __eou__ And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . __eou__ Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? __eou__ Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . __eou__ Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . __eou__ I'm sorry - I still don't understand . __eou__ You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . __eou__ So , will I be able to find this book ? __eou__ Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . __eou__ Okay . Thank you . I understand now . __eou__ Will there be anything else ? __eou__ No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again ! __eou__
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? __eou__ No . I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah . I worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant . __eou__ What was that like ? __eou__ It was always very busy there . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . __eou__ Did you get any perks on the job ? __eou__ Yeah . I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . __eou__
This is my admission card , and these are the books . __eou__ OK , a moment , please . __eou__ By the way , can I renew the borrowing ? __eou__ For which one ? __eou__ Sense and Sensibility , English version . __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Can I just do it here ? __eou__ Sorry . No . You should go to the other counter . __eou__ OK , thanks . __eou__ Sorry , this biography is over the deadline . You should pay extra for it . __eou__ I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library ... anyway , how much should I pay ? __eou__ 3 Yuan , please . __eou__ Here you are . Thanks . __eou__ You are welcome . See you next time . __eou__
Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... __eou__ Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . __eou__ Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? __eou__ That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . __eou__ And when do you prepare for your final exam ? __eou__ Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . __eou__ Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? __eou__ Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . __eou__ Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! __eou__ But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . __eou__ Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? __eou__ Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . __eou__
Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . __eou__ Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . __eou__ That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated . __eou__ You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old . __eou__ No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again . __eou__ One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished . __eou__ How could he make such a silly mistake ? __eou__ He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then . __eou__ He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . __eou__ That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . __eou__
What do you like to do with your free time ? __eou__ Study English . __eou__ You mean you like to study English ? Why ? __eou__ It gives me great satisfaction . __eou__ Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction.It ' s hard work . __eou__ I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . __eou__
What do you think of your teacher ? __eou__ He's very strict with us . __eou__ And I hear he gives very good lectures . __eou__ Indeed . He's strict with himself , too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . __eou__
Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ? __eou__ Because Myra was cheating on exams , and she spoke back rudely . __eou__ I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . __eou__
Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? __eou__ Yes , I am applying on it . __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... __eou__ Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . __eou__ I know , but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . __eou__ Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . __eou__ Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . __eou__
Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . __eou__ It's huge ! __eou__ Yeah . They're usually this big . __eou__ The craftsmanship is excellent . __eou__ All the parts work . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now . __eou__ What's your favorite course , Daniel ? __eou__ I like science most . __eou__ Science ? That's a surprise . __eou__ Surprise ? __eou__ I thought you would like PE . __eou__ I do like PE , but I am interested in science . __eou__ Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . __eou__ Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . __eou__ Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy . __eou__ Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__
Could you please help me to check out the book ? __eou__ Sure , what's the author's name , please . __eou__ I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ... __eou__ Charles Dickens ? __eou__ No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature . __eou__ OK , do you know the title of the book ? __eou__ Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket . __eou__ So , show me the note please . __eou__ I can't find it now . __eou__ Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ? __eou__ Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography . __eou__ OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Excuse me , Miss . __eou__ Yes . May I help you ? __eou__ I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . __eou__ I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now.Could you come back about 3,30 ? __eou__ Sure . 3:30 this afternoon . __eou__ Good . See you later . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
Our maths teacher is rather humorous . __eou__ On the contrary , I think he's very serious . __eou__ No , not at all.His examples are really interesting . __eou__ So they're easy to remember . __eou__ Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? __eou__ He's an old antique , very serious . __eou__ Bad luck , Anne . __eou__ Hey ! How about your history teacher ? __eou__ She's another antique . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__
what do you hope to do when you finish university ? __eou__ I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ? __eou__ after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide __eou__ we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions . __eou__ if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored . __eou__ unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed . __eou__ that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . __eou__ as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it . __eou__ my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field . __eou__ I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to check these books out . __eou__ Do you have your library card ? __eou__ Here it is . __eou__ It appears that you have late fees . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , really . __eou__ How much do I owe ? __eou__ You owe $ 24.50 in late fees . __eou__ I don ’ t have that much today . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books . __eou__ I ’ ll pay it as soon as possible . __eou__
Professor , I will not be here for our next class meeting . __eou__ Is this absolutely necessary ? __eou__ I tried to work something out , but I really do have to miss one class . __eou__ Will you be able to make up the work you missed ? __eou__ I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading . __eou__ Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester . __eou__ Yes , I remember . __eou__ Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . __eou__ Make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester ! __eou__
Could you help me to register for a class ? __eou__ Do you know what class you want to take ? __eou__ Are there any Psychology classes available ? __eou__ I believe there are still two Psychology classes open . __eou__ On what days are the classes ? __eou__ There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 . __eou__ Can you tell me about the other class ? __eou__ It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday . __eou__ You're positive that these are the only classes left ? __eou__ These two are the only ones . __eou__ The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine . __eou__ Very good . __eou__
How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? __eou__ It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies . __eou__ You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! __eou__ I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . __eou__ So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? __eou__ No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . __eou__ So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__
How long have you been in America ? __eou__ For more than five years . __eou__ Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? __eou__ It's no picnic . __eou__
What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . __eou__ Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . __eou__ Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? __eou__ He asked me how long it took me to learn English . __eou__ But , you were born and raised in California ! __eou__ Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . __eou__ What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? __eou__ You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . __eou__ So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? __eou__ I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . __eou__ Are you sure he really got the message ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . __eou__ That's hilarious ! What did he say ? __eou__ He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . __eou__ I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . __eou__
Are you studying any languages here ? __eou__ Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department . __eou__ What are you majoring in ? __eou__ I'm majoring in English . __eou__ Is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . __eou__ Do you know anything about Britain and America ? __eou__ I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture . __eou__ Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . __eou__ You're right . __eou__
How are your Chinese lessons going ? __eou__ Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English . __eou__ Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier . __eou__ Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese . __eou__ Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier . __eou__ Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese . __eou__
Do you have the notes from last week's class ? __eou__ Did you come late ? __eou__ I couldn't make it . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ I was sick . __eou__ Oh , okay . Well , here you go . __eou__ Are these all of them ? __eou__ Oh , wait , here are the rest . __eou__ Thanks a bunch . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Can you help me buy my textbooks ? __eou__ There will probably be a book list in the bookstore . Do you have your class schedule handy ? __eou__ No , I don't have that . __eou__ To get started , take that list over to the bookstore . Do you know where the bookstore is ? __eou__ I am not sure where the bookstore is . __eou__ When you pass the gym , it'll be the first door on the left . Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money ? __eou__ Yes , I knew I could do that . Exactly how do I go about selling them ? __eou__ If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door , he will reimburse you . Can you go over there today ? __eou__ I think maybe I could be there . __eou__ I am free at 1 __eou__ Maybe that would work . __eou__ I'll catch you later then . Have a wonderful morning . __eou__
I want to know how to buy something from this machine . __eou__ Yeah , the new ones can be tricky . What are you trying to buy ? __eou__ I want to buy one of those snack things . __eou__ Are you ready to go ? __eou__ I'm clear so far . __eou__ The money goes in the slot over there . It has to be smooth to go in . __eou__ It won't go in ! __eou__ Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work . __eou__ Yes , next step . __eou__ Make your selection and hope for the best . Vending machines aren't all that reliable . __eou__ They're totally unreliable . __eou__ You seem to have it down . Have a good day ! __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I am trying to find this book . __eou__ What ’ s the problem ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it . __eou__ Have you checked the computer ? __eou__ I have already . __eou__ What did it say ? __eou__ It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there . __eou__ I can always borrow the book from another library . __eou__ You can do that ? __eou__ I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . __eou__
What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to return a book . __eou__ Can I do anything else for you ? __eou__ I would also like to check out this video . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes , just the video . __eou__ May I see your library card ? __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ You have to take care of this video . __eou__ Oh , I will . __eou__ You will be fined if you damage it . __eou__ I understand . Thank you very much . __eou__
Excuse me , Professor , is there a time when I could meet with you ? __eou__ I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best ? __eou__ I would like to come in at three o'clock . __eou__ I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ? __eou__ Yes , I can . __eou__ Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor . __eou__ I got it . __eou__ If you do get lost , just ask someone in the building to point the way . __eou__ Thank you , I'll be there . __eou__ If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call ! __eou__
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ? __eou__ Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ? __eou__ I'm thinking about taking his class next semester . __eou__ He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ? __eou__ I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades . __eou__ Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ? __eou__ I really need to learn this stuff . __eou__ He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? __eou__ Yes , that sounds right for me . __eou__ Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ? __eou__ Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing . __eou__ I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year ! __eou__
What date will our field trip be on ? __eou__ The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ? __eou__ Yes , I will make note of that . __eou__ Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7 __eou__ I will be there half an hour early . __eou__ You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ? __eou__ Yes , someone is picking me up . __eou__ To get back to campus by 8 __eou__ Not at the moment — maybe later , though . __eou__ All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday ! __eou__
What is the best place to park ? __eou__ What vehicle do you usually bring to school ? Is it an automobile or a motorbike ? __eou__ I drive a motorcycle . __eou__ OK . That means you can park in the student lot or on the street . Have you seen the handicapped spots ? __eou__ I am not sure what a handicapped spot is . __eou__ Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces . Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ? __eou__ I park days and evenings . __eou__ Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ? __eou__ What signs ? __eou__ As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ? __eou__ What curb colors ? __eou__ If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK . __eou__
I'm here for my appointment . __eou__ What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I have an issue with my schedule . __eou__ Tell me the problem . __eou__ I have two classes on here that are at the same time . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Can you change that for me ? __eou__ Do you still want both classes ? __eou__ Yes , I would like to keep both classes . __eou__ I'll try to change one to a different day . __eou__ I would greatly appreciate that . __eou__
Could we go over some things , because I think my test score is wrong . __eou__ What do you think is wrong , the math or the way your answer was scored ? __eou__ Both . __eou__ I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes , too . Will that work for you ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm ready . __eou__ Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake . __eou__ These look strange . __eou__ Yes , I agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score . Would that be OK ? __eou__ OK , let's do the calculation . __eou__ We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask ! __eou__
How do you decide what grade we get ? __eou__ I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests . __eou__ What is the most important factor ? __eou__ Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning . __eou__ How can we keep track of our grades ? __eou__ The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent . __eou__ What if we can't get to school ? __eou__ You can only miss one class without penalty . __eou__ If we have a major problem , will you let us know ? __eou__ I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem . __eou__
May I help you with something ? __eou__ I would like to return some books . __eou__ I ’ ll take them . __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ These books were due two weeks ago . __eou__ Yeah . I totally forgot they were due . __eou__ You will need to pay late fees on these books . __eou__ How much are the late fees ? __eou__ The fee is 25 cents every day . __eou__ I have to pay 25 cents a day ? __eou__ And that ’ s for each book that is late . __eou__ That shouldn ’ t be a problem . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I was looking for a book , but I couldn ’ t find it . __eou__ Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf ? __eou__ I already did . __eou__ Is it on the shelf ? __eou__ I didn ’ t see it . __eou__ Apparently somebody took that book out of the library . __eou__ Will you ever get another copy ? __eou__ We will definitely be getting another . __eou__ Could you please reserve it for me ? __eou__ That won ’ t be a problem . __eou__ Thanks . I really appreciate that . __eou__

Don ’ t worry . __eou__
What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I would like to use a computer . __eou__ Do you have your library card ? __eou__ I sure do . __eou__ There is a wait for the computers . __eou__ That ’ s all right . __eou__ You need to print your name on this list . __eou__ Okay . Now what ? __eou__ Once a computer is available , I will let you know . __eou__ How am I supposed to log on to the computer ? __eou__ All you do is type in the number on the back of your card . __eou__ That ’ s it ?

Which one is the cheapest ? __eou__ the tuition is the same for all of them . __eou__ which one has the most interesting course ? __eou__ I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical . __eou__ where would you like to be located ? __eou__ I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . __eou__ have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ? __eou__ not yet . __eou__ I think you should do that soon .

By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? __eou__ do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? __eou__ oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . __eou__ no . those you have to provide for yourself . __eou__ what do most of the students do ? __eou__ well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f __eou__ then , I might as well have them made . __eou__ Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . __eou__ hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . __eou__ it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . __eou__ here's Lisa .

hello ! How are you today ? __eou__ hi . I ’ m feeling very nervous . I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did . __eou__ it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ Ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers . __eou__ that ’ s true . I really should go home and prepare for the next test , but I ’ m feeling tired . __eou__ let ’ s go and get a coffee together . That will help you to wake up again ! __eou__ ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ? __eou__ oh , you know me . I ’ m always happy ! If I think I ’ m getting into a bad mood , I call some friends and socialize or have a chat . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody . __eou__ I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people . __eou__ perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests ! __eou__
I see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . Are there any interesting articles in it ? __eou__ There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T __eou__ I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . __eou__ Which tests do you mean ? __eou__ You know . Tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ? __eou__ Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . __eou__ Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . __eou__ You ’ re right . It ’ s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles . __eou__
Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? __eou__ Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . __eou__ Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this __eou__ Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? __eou__ It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! __eou__ It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b __eou__ Is that better ? __eou__ Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? __eou__ Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__ That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any __eou__
Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? __eou__ Cinct de mayo ? __eou__ No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . __eou__ Do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . __eou__ Www , man ! __eou__ In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__ Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? __eou__ Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . __eou__ And then what happened ? __eou__ Well , as we say , the rest is history ... __eou__
I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . __eou__ Calm down . __eou__
Here ’ s a letter for you . __eou__ Let me see it . __eou__ Who ’ s the letter from ? __eou__ It ’ s a letter from UCLA about my acceptance . __eou__ Read it ! __eou__ UCLA accepted me ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ I ’ m not joking . I got accepted ! __eou__ I ’ m so happy for you ! __eou__ UCLA was my second choice , but I ’ m happy knowing I ’ Ve been accepted . __eou__ I am really proud of you . __eou__ You have no idea how proud I am of myself . __eou__
To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . __eou__ To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course I'ever had . __eou__ How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__ It is still a mystery to me . __eou__
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . __eou__ Yes , it's to my liking , too . __eou__ Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? __eou__ It's my dream . __eou__
I feel so uncomfortable . __eou__ Are you sick ? __eou__ No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . __eou__ He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . __eou__
Mark is parade his knowledge again . __eou__ Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge . __eou__ A well-learned person never does that . __eou__
What are you thinking about ? __eou__ About my boyfriend . __eou__ Again ! __eou__ You are really a wet blanket . __eou__
Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . __eou__ No foot gives out scent . __eou__ But don't forget you are in a cafe . __eou__ Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . __eou__ I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . __eou__ Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . __eou__ You should feel shameful for your behavior . __eou__ I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . __eou__ I'm really sick of you . __eou__
Mike ! Look at the floor ! __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! __eou__ Oh ... __eou__ It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . __eou__ Sorry , love . __eou__ What are you looking for now ? __eou__ My cigarettes . __eou__ Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . __eou__ In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? __eou__
This small town has many serious problems . __eou__ What's the cause ? __eou__ The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . __eou__ I see why it lags behind other towns . __eou__
Tom , is Jenny crying ? __eou__ Can you take he away from me ? __eou__ I ’ m just coming for that . __eou__ She kept on bothering me . __eou__ She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? __eou__ But I am her brother , not her servant . __eou__
Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . __eou__ I'm looking for it , but you see , the market is hard up for jobs , too . __eou__ You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . __eou__
It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul . __eou__ The boy is good for nothing . __eou__ As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him . __eou__ He is hopeless . __eou__
I am so bored all day . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . __eou__ Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . __eou__
He has come to life in the end . __eou__ Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him . __eou__ Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital . __eou__ Right . Unless , who know what will happen . __eou__ Wish him to be healthy soon . __eou__
How do you do , Prof.Smith . __eou__ How do you do , Ms . Yang.You speak very good English . __eou__ Thank you . I begin to like English even when I was a child . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ At school , in China.This is my first time to be out of my own country . __eou__ It's amazing . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__
Congratulations ! You've just won a car ! __eou__ It's too good to be true . __eou__
Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on . __eou__ Thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . __eou__ Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . __eou__ I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? __eou__ Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__
Guess what I've brought for you . __eou__ Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__
Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm . __eou__ Congratulations . That's great ! __eou__ I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore . __eou__ When do you start ? __eou__ I start next Monday . __eou__ You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know . __eou__ I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . __eou__ I bet . You must be stoked . __eou__ Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? __eou__ Sure . It's on you right ? __eou__ Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ? __eou__ I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now . __eou__ I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . __eou__
Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? __eou__ The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . __eou__ Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . __eou__ Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . __eou__ But this chance is really precious . __eou__ Well , I know . So I am thinking now . __eou__ I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . __eou__ Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should tell me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I am telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you would be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You are all the same . __eou__
I'm really sorry , Bob . I accidentally damaged your bike . __eou__ Uh-oh . It'll probably cost a lot to fix it . __eou__ I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money . __eou__
Hello , Dora , I haven't seen you for a long time . Where have you been ? __eou__ I didn ’ t go anywhere . I stayed at home . __eou__ What's up ? You look unhappy . __eou__ Nothing . I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family . __eou__ Oh , I know . Sometimes I have the same feeling with you . But you'd better not be so emotional . __eou__ Can you stay and accompany me for a while ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . You can call me any time you are alone from now on . __eou__ Thank you so much . You are so sweet . __eou__ Not at all . We are friends . __eou__
I like your new skirt . __eou__ Do you think it fits me ? __eou__ Yes . It looks terrific ! __eou__ I bought it at half price . __eou__ You were lucky to find it . __eou__
I just heard that you won the long-distance race . Congratulations on your victory . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today . __eou__ I will try my best . __eou__
Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ? __eou__ I'm so relieved . I just passed the bar exam . __eou__ You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ? __eou__ That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier . __eou__ Did you tell your parents yet ? __eou__ Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight . __eou__ They're probably going to be so happy . __eou__ I think so . It's turning out to be a great day . __eou__
Jack , what's wrong ? __eou__ You ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? What did I do ? __eou__ You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? __eou__ No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . __eou__ She started feeling suspicious after you said that . __eou__ I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . __eou__ Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . __eou__ Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends . __eou__ Don't bother . __eou__
David , why don't you clean your room ? __eou__ I am not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depress ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . __eou__ I don't think she would do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and it made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh , I just can't forget it . __eou__
You ’ re making my blood boil . __eou__ Calm down . Madam . __eou__ I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . __eou__ I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems . __eou__ Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? __eou__ I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . __eou__ Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! __eou__ If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . __eou__
There ’ s a letter here for you . __eou__ Let me see it . __eou__ What ’ s the letter about ? __eou__ It ’ s a letter from NYU . __eou__ Tell me what it says ! __eou__ I didn ’ t get in . __eou__ You ’ re lying . __eou__ I ’ m not lying . __eou__ Are you upset ? __eou__ I had high hopes for NYU . __eou__ I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . __eou__ Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . __eou__
What's this then ? __eou__ It's my geography , sir . The Map of Africa you set us . __eou__ But this should have been handed in last Thursday . __eou__ Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__ My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . __eou__ Oh , Yes ? __eou__ It's true , sir . __eou__
Are you a newcomer ? __eou__ Yeah , this is my first visit here . __eou__ You speak good English , though . __eou__ Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . __eou__ But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German.By the way , how long have you been learning English ? __eou__ On and off , for quite a few years . __eou__
Are you new to this school ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m new . __eou__ Is this your first year in college ? __eou__ I transferred from another school . __eou__ Where did you transfer from ? __eou__ I was at PCC before . __eou__ Why did you transfer ? __eou__ I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ Did you like it at PCC ? __eou__ PCC is an incredible school . __eou__ Well , I wish you luck here . __eou__ I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . __eou__
Have you figured out where you want to transfer to ? __eou__ I can ’ t think of where to go . __eou__ Where would you like to go to school ? __eou__ I really don ’ t know . __eou__ You can ’ t think of anything ? __eou__ I really like where I ’ m at now . __eou__ So , why don ’ t you just stay here ? __eou__ That may be what I ’ m going to do . __eou__ It ’ s a perfectly good school . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? __eou__ I ’ m just going to stay at PCC . __eou__
Oh , no ! __eou__ How dreadful ! __eou__ Look at the view from the window . __eou__ Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected . __eou__ It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . __eou__ It can ’ t be helped . __eou__
Oh , no . It looks like we're late . __eou__ Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . __eou__ There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? __eou__ They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . __eou__ That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . __eou__ Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! __eou__
Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__
He got the scholarship to Harvard . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ It's true . He is a hard worker . __eou__ I know he really deserves this . __eou__
What do you think about violence in movies ? __eou__ Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . __eou__ But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? __eou__ If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . __eou__
When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . __eou__ The last straw , huh ? __eou__ Yes , he's really pushed me too far . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__
Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ? __eou__ Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk . __eou__ The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought . __eou__ Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago . __eou__ That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith . __eou__ Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry . __eou__ I'm really sick ! __eou__
I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . __eou__ It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__ But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . __eou__ Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__ This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . __eou__ It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . __eou__
Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . __eou__ But not as good as your mother's , right ? __eou__ Actually , it's better ... __eou__ What ? Are you kidding ? __eou__ No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... __eou__ Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! __eou__ OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... __eou__
Did you go to the movie yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ What did you think of it ? __eou__ I don't think much of the film . __eou__ I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . __eou__ Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . __eou__ I can't think the same . __eou__ What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you . __eou__
What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feelings exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel . __eou__
You ’ re all set now ? __eou__ Oh , thank you so much . __eou__ Really , it was nothing . __eou__ I really appreciated it . __eou__ I was happy to help . __eou__ It was so kind of you . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__ You ’ re a real friend in need . __eou__
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . __eou__ Then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . __eou__ Would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . __eou__ Ok , thank you . __eou__
I have a problem . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ The delivery people showed up four hours late . __eou__ I apologize for their tardiness . __eou__ I was late for work because of them . __eou__ Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ I want my money back for the delivery . __eou__ Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . __eou__ It shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ I'm going to refund your money right now . __eou__
Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . __eou__ What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . __eou__ Then what shall I do ? __eou__ Call the police . __eou__
When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . __eou__ It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . __eou__ I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . __eou__
What are you thinking about ? __eou__ About my boyfriend . __eou__ Again ! __eou__ You are really a wet blanket . __eou__
You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? __eou__ Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . __eou__ Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? __eou__ No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . __eou__
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . __eou__ If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ She a as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? __eou__
What courses are you taking ? __eou__ Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . __eou__ What do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring ! __eou__ That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ? __eou__ Yes , my oral English teacher is an American . He is from a small town in California . __eou__ What is he like ? __eou__ He is great . He always tells us not to study for exams , and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing . __eou__ Are you able to follow him ? __eou__ Not everything , but nearly . He speaks very clearly . __eou__ Oh , that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher . __eou__ Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him . __eou__
Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . __eou__ What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . __eou__ I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . __eou__ Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . __eou__ You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? __eou__ But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . __eou__ Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . __eou__ Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . __eou__ I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . __eou__ Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . __eou__ That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . __eou__ How about a training course ? __eou__ A training course ? That must be costly . __eou__ But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . __eou__ OK , let's have a try . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . __eou__ Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ He ’ s nearly 90 . __eou__ Good gracious ! Are you sure ? __eou__ I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . __eou__ Is she really ? __eou__ Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . __eou__ Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? __eou__
Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ? __eou__ Stay away from me . __eou__ Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? __eou__ I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . __eou__ That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . __eou__ Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you . __eou__
There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know . __eou__ What ? __eou__ She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week . __eou__ What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? __eou__ Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy . __eou__ Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! __eou__
what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forget all about it . __eou__ How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__ It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__ I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__ I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__
What happen , John ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Why do you look unhappy ? __eou__ I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . __eou__
Shall I get you another cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes , please . That is very kind of you . __eou__ Shall I make more sandwiches ? __eou__ No , thanks . I ’ Ve had plenty . __eou__
Maybe we'd better go now . __eou__ It's still early . __eou__ Gosh , it's already 10.Stay here if you like . __eou__ Since we're late , let's go to see a film . __eou__ OK.Hurry up . __eou__
What a terrible house ! __eou__ I'm sick of it , too . __eou__ The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . __eou__ It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Come in , come in ! __eou__ Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . __eou__ Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . __eou__
They promised us a sea view . __eou__ Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__ Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__
Er ... Alison ? __eou__ Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ... __eou__ I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win . __eou__ Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ... __eou__ It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really ! __eou__ Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . __eou__
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . __eou__ Yes , it's to my liking , too . __eou__ Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? __eou__ It's my dream . __eou__
Are you there , Mary ? __eou__ I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest ! __eou__ How much is my stamp ? __eou__ Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? __eou__ Don't get ahead of yourself . Fat boy isn't yours yet . __eou__ His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes . __eou__
I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! __eou__ So glad that you think so ! __eou__ I think you deserve a promotion . __eou__ Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess . __eou__
I think it's important that all people have the ability to read . __eou__ I agree with you , but that's easier said than done . __eou__
How would you like your hair cut ? __eou__ I want it short . __eou__ Then , I'll just trim it . __eou__ It will do . __eou__
I ’ m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ? __eou__ What ? You ’ re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago . __eou__ I know , but I ’ m really tired . My stomach feels funny . __eou__ What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late . __eou__ Then when did you go to sleep ? __eou__ About 2 o ’ clock in the morning . __eou__ When ? __eou__ About 2 o ’ clock . __eou__ Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ? __eou__ You did , but I can ’ t help it . __eou__ This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ? __eou__ Which one do I choose ? I don ’ t want to give up , but I really feel tired . __eou__ So , make up your mind quickly . Whether to keep going or give up . __eou__ Let me think about it . What should I do ? I think I will not give up . __eou__
Susan has been down recently . I saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! __eou__ You have any idea why ? __eou__ She broke up with her boyfriend . __eou__ I heard her boyfriend is married . __eou__ She still loves him . That's why she feels upset . Her love is always hard and confusing ... __eou__ Then what about you ? How are you getting on with your boyfriend ? __eou__ He sometimes really drives me crazy . __eou__
Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? __eou__ I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__ Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__ I am wiped out . Thank you . __eou__ Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Never ! But thank you for inviting me . __eou__ Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . __eou__
Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? __eou__ You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . __eou__ How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? __eou__ He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . __eou__ Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . __eou__ You think he might stay even longer ? ! __eou__ Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! __eou__ That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! __eou__
I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s alright . __eou__ I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow . __eou__ No . Please don ’ t . I couldn ’ t let you do that . __eou__
OH , This is the famous Emperor Palace building . __eou__ It ’ s huge . __eou__ Would you like to go to the top ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ The view is breath-taking . __eou__
So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim . __eou__ You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . __eou__ I understand how you feel , but you ’ Ve gotta learn to move on . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike . __eou__
I just got laid off . The awful business , you know . __eou__ I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . __eou__ Oh , you poor thing ! __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . __eou__ Well , they are very nice you know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh , I don't care about that . __eou__ Everybody is buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . __eou__ I see . __eou__ But thank you very much all the same . __eou__ Sorry I couldn't help you . __eou__
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__ It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__ What did you think you were doing ? __eou__ I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__ How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__ I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ Never do that again . __eou__ I promise . __eou__
Is anything the matter , sir ? __eou__ Yes , it's my steak . __eou__ What's wrong with it , sir ? __eou__ It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . __eou__ I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? __eou__ Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you . __eou__ I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ? __eou__ Yes , please give me another Calsberg . __eou__ Can I bring you some dessert ? __eou__ No , thank you . I've had enough . __eou__ How about some coffee or tea then ? __eou__ Yes , I will have a cup of coffee . __eou__
We have absolute proof that you committed the crime . __eou__ That's absolutely ridiculous ! __eou__
Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . __eou__
The concert was really great . __eou__ I agree . __eou__ The singing group used to be very popular . __eou__ I can't believe they would play so good . __eou__
Philip , I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there . __eou__ Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! __eou__ Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! __eou__
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? __eou__ It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . __eou__ Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? __eou__ Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... __eou__ Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__ You're dancing so well . __eou__ You dance beautifully too . __eou__ When did you learn to dance ? __eou__ In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__
are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! __eou__ I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . __eou__ Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... __eou__ No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . __eou__ What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__ They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__ That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__ I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! __eou__
Mary ? Are you still there ? __eou__ Yes . What do you want ? __eou__ Did your bid win ? __eou__ What do you care , dork ? __eou__ Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ? __eou__ You mean fat boy ? __eou__ Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted . __eou__
Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? __eou__ Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all . __eou__ So you didn ’ t . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . __eou__ You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . __eou__ But you know if he brought it or not , right ? __eou__ Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . __eou__
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ I guess I never thought of that before . __eou__ And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! __eou__
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__ I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . __eou__
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__ No , I'm not clear . __eou__ we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__ Don't make a fuss.The price is rising __eou__
Let me clear away the broken glass . __eou__ No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . __eou__ It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . __eou__ Never mind . __eou__
I'm scared that she might not come back . __eou__ No , I don't think she's that strong-minded . __eou__ But she took her luggage away with her . __eou__ She will be back soon.You can wait and see . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . __eou__
How do you feel about the TV series ? __eou__ Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . __eou__ Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . __eou__ But I don't think much of it . __eou__
I am so glad I caught you at home . I need your help ! __eou__ What's up , Robert ? __eou__ Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight ! __eou__ Slow down . What are you talking about ? __eou__ It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now . __eou__
Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? __eou__ Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again ! __eou__ How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight . __eou__ Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ... __eou__ Look , it's starting ! __eou__ Mysteries of the Pyramids . Didn't we watch this program last week ? __eou__
Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together . __eou__ Birds of a feather flock together . __eou__
Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? __eou__ Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . __eou__ What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! __eou__ Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__ Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . __eou__ What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! __eou__
You are an eager beaver . __eou__ Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life . __eou__
Reciting texts really bores me to death . __eou__ Do you have to remember every text ? __eou__ Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . __eou__
I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore . __eou__ Young people enjoy pop songs more . __eou__ It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . __eou__ But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs . __eou__
Bother the flies ! __eou__ Where do they come from ? __eou__ I don't know . Something rotten here ? __eou__ I can't see it . __eou__
That woman is a thorough drag ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ She keeps spitting on the ground . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with her . __eou__
I am really impressed with your presentation skills . __eou__ Thank you . I have been working on it for several years . __eou__ Well , your time has been well spent ! __eou__ It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff ! __eou__ Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! __eou__
We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? __eou__ It ’ s so cool ! __eou__
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! __eou__ Why ? What are they like ? __eou__ They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! __eou__ Have you ever talked to them about it ? __eou__ I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! __eou__ What did they say ? __eou__ They both just talk about how great they are all the time . __eou__ They soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__ They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__ I thought you didn't talk to them much . __eou__ I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . __eou__ What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? __eou__ Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . __eou__ Maybe you should think about moving . __eou__ I can't afford to move right now . __eou__ Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . __eou__ I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . __eou__ Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? __eou__
This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up . __eou__ En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me . __eou__
Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . __eou__ I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . __eou__
Hurry up . Time is running out . __eou__ I see . I have run as fast as I can . __eou__
what a nice uniform ! __eou__ thanks ; do you like it ? __eou__ not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? __eou__ yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . __eou__ they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? __eou__ I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . __eou__ so are you enjoying your new job ? __eou__ it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . __eou__ how do you like working in sales ? __eou__ I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . __eou__ that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department . __eou__ yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman ! __eou__ I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos ! __eou__ how do you know her ? __eou__ she's my cousin . __eou__ why didn't you tell me about that before ? __eou__ I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting . __eou__ well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime . __eou__ that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . __eou__
wow , it that your sports car ? __eou__ yes , do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? __eou__ it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ when's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ it must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ what else is wrong with it ? __eou__ the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ anything else ? __eou__ the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__
are you ready to go the concert ? __eou__ yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? __eou__ actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . __eou__ that's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . __eou__ is your helmet comfortable ? __eou__ not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . __eou__ maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . __eou__ I'll think about it . __eou__ is that your new bicycle ? __eou__ yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? __eou__ it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! __eou__ nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . __eou__ I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ that's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . __eou__ is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? __eou__ it's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . __eou__
You are freaking me out . __eou__ You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me ! __eou__
Look at what you have done . All thumbs . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . __eou__
The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise . Time to get paddling . __eou__ Oh , no ! No more paddling ! My arms are sore ! __eou__ Do not worry . Today will be easier . __eou__ Beth , what date is today ? __eou__ Today is Saturday . __eou__ What is the date today ? __eou__ Today is July 4th . __eou__ Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday . __eou__ Call her on my cell phone . Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day . __eou__ Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ? __eou__ It is December 25th . __eou__ Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day . __eou__ Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? __eou__ April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! __eou__ That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6 __eou__ I guess so . __eou__ How about going for swim around 10 __eou__ That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated . __eou__ Happy Independence Day ! __eou__
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long __eou__ It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__ Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__ Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ Not funny . __eou__
Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? __eou__ Yes , here you go . __eou__ Will you be checking any bags today . __eou__ Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . __eou__ What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd ! __eou__ I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . __eou__ Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . __eou__ Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . __eou__ That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! __eou__
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ Have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ Well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ Geez . Is that all ? __eou__ Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . __eou__ Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! __eou__ Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? __eou__ I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural . __eou__ Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . __eou__ I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing . __eou__ I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . __eou__ You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! __eou__
Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . __eou__ I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . __eou__ don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . __eou__ thanks for understanding . __eou__ well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? __eou__ hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . __eou__ Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . __eou__ I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . __eou__ maybe ... I'll think about it . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__
I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! __eou__ Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! __eou__
I'd like to talk with you again about what happened . __eou__ Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse . __eou__
So , you ’ re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ? __eou__ I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby .

I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ’ m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ’ vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March . __eou__ And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ? __eou__ Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations ! __eou__
This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing ! __eou__ It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip . __eou__ Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke ! __eou__ I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier ! __eou__ Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far ! __eou__ It ’ s fine . Jump in ! __eou__ Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark ! __eou__ Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me ! __eou__ It ’ s right under you ! Kathy ! ! ! __eou__
Hurry up . We're going to be late . __eou__ I am hurrying . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I can't figure out which dress to wear . __eou__
You're acting weird tonight . __eou__ I'm just in the mood to act goofy . __eou__ What brought this on ? __eou__ I guess I'm glad exams are over . __eou__
I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday . __eou__ If you would like me to , I could help you with that . __eou__ Wouldn't that take you away from your project ? __eou__ I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . __eou__ Is there a good time for you to help me ? __eou__ If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday . __eou__ How about meeting in my office ? __eou__ That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . __eou__ Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot . __eou__ Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise ! __eou__
What's your favorite magazine ? __eou__ Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . __eou__ What kind of magazine is it ? __eou__ It's instructive and inspiring . __eou__ Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? __eou__ No , it's a semimonthly . __eou__ Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? __eou__ Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . __eou__ Oh , I think I should try to read one . __eou__
Say , what's your favorite sport ? __eou__ Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better . __eou__ Do you play much tennis ? __eou__ Yes , quite a bit .

Let's celebrate ! __eou__
What happened ? __eou__ It was just a misunderstanding . __eou__
Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? __eou__ It was fun , I tell you . __eou__ Tell me about it , will you ? __eou__ Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight ! __eou__ Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures ? __eou__ Sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . __eou__ You were lucky then . __eou__ Yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there , too . __eou__ What did you do after that ? __eou__ We went for a swim in the sea . That was the biggest part of the day . Just look at my nice tan ! __eou__ So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . __eou__ Yes , you are right . And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back . My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday . __eou__
Get changed ! __eou__ What for ? __eou__

I've moved . __eou__ Where to ? __eou__

Don't be afraid . Give it a try . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . __eou__ I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! __eou__ I was thinking it could take place sometime in January . __eou__ That might be a little too cold for some people . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . __eou__ Yes , that would work out better . __eou__ You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . __eou__ Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . __eou__ Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now ! __eou__
It's all over . I'm bankrupt . __eou__ Don't worry . Everything will be fine . __eou__
What's new ? __eou__ Nothing much . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende . __eou__ Great . What do you think of it ? __eou__ The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . __eou__ Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? __eou__ Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . __eou__ It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? __eou__ Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . __eou__ What is the special local product ? __eou__ The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . __eou__ I hope to go there someday . __eou__
I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday . __eou__ I could help you with that . __eou__ Are you sure you have the time ? __eou__ I promise you that I have the time to do this .

I was thinking about applying for the new position . __eou__ Do you think that is a good idea ? __eou__ It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . __eou__ What are your main concerns ? __eou__ Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . __eou__ I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . __eou__ I am also thinking about the pay . __eou__ Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? __eou__ Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain . __eou__ I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you . __eou__
Let's do something different today . __eou__ Like how ? __eou__ I would like you to give me a different hair style . __eou__ What did you have in mind ? __eou__ Give me a short haircut . __eou__ Do you know how short you want your hair to be ? __eou__ I want you to cut it to a few inches long . __eou__ That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ? __eou__ I've had this idea for some time now . __eou__ I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . __eou__ This is what I want . __eou__ Fine then . Let's get started . __eou__
Are you satisfied with the dishes ? __eou__ Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible . __eou__ I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish . __eou__ Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 __eou__ If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it . __eou__ Great , I love hot food too . __eou__ Well , let's finish this great dinner first . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting . __eou__ So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? __eou__

Where are you going ? __eou__ I'm going to buy a CD . __eou__ Why not listen to music online ? __eou__ Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? __eou__ You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . __eou__ I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . __eou__ In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . __eou__ Can you recommend some to me ? __eou__ Certainly . Realplayer is a good . __eou__ Can I download it ? __eou__ Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . __eou__ I'll try it tonight . __eou__
How was the party ? __eou__ I had a fantastic time . __eou__
Happy birthday ! Many happy returns ( of the day ) . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
How do you like my new sports car ? __eou__ It's cool . __eou__
What did you say ? __eou__ Are you deaf or what ? __eou__
Do you have the time ? __eou__ It's ten thirty . __eou__
How was your trip to America ? __eou__ We had a fantastic time . __eou__ Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ? __eou__ No , but we went to the Kennedy Center . __eou__
I'm really mad at Bob . __eou__ What for ? ( Why ? ) __eou__
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Canada . __eou__
It's very cold tonight ! __eou__ Can I get you another blanket ? __eou__ 0h , that would be nice of you . __eou__ I'll turn the heat up . __eou__ Yes , please do that . __eou__
There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? __eou__ Is it formal or informal ? __eou__ I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . __eou__ In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . __eou__ You are right . What about shoes ? __eou__ The brown leather shoes are OK . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
Freeze ! __eou__ Don't shoot . I give up . __eou__
We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . __eou__ I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . __eou__ Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? __eou__ Why not ? I'd love to do that . __eou__ Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ) __eou__ Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? __eou__ Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? __eou__ I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . __eou__ No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . __eou__ Unbelievable ! I could never do that . __eou__ Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum . __eou__ Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? __eou__ Yes , let's do it . __eou__ Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . __eou__ Of course not . We don't do that . __eou__
Do you like plum blossoms ? __eou__ Certainly . I prefer the winter and I love plum blossoms much more . __eou__ It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? __eou__ Seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? That's a good idea . Let's go ! __eou__ What a heavy snow ! __eou__ Take care ! Don't slip down to the ground . __eou__ I've got it . I like the sound of stepping on the snow very much . __eou__ Yes . Very wonderful . __eou__ Do you smell the sweet scent ? __eou__ Yes . It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms . __eou__ The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness . __eou__
Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . __eou__ How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . __eou__ The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . __eou__ Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? __eou__ Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . __eou__ I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? __eou__ Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . __eou__ If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . __eou__
Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you . __eou__ Thank you , Paul . __eou__
Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . __eou__ Yes , I saw one . Believe me . __eou__ You must have seen some other kind of bird . __eou__
Do you know where Helen is ? __eou__ She's gone to a flower shop . Today is her husband's birthday . __eou__ That reminds me . My wedding anniversary is tomorrow . __eou__
This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . __eou__ I won't do it again . Please forgive me . __eou__ No way . I've given you too many chances already . __eou__
I heard Betty lost her tennis match this morning , so she's out of the tournament . __eou__ Really ? What a shame ! I thought she was going to win this one . __eou__ Me , too . I'm sure she'll do better in the next tournament . __eou__
How annoying ! __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with the program . __eou__
You wouldn't believe what happened to me today . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared . He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . It was so embarrassing . __eou__
David , I heard you lost your job . __eou__ Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me . __eou__ Well , that'll teach you to control your temper . __eou__
Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . __eou__ Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said . __eou__ Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . __eou__ I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? __eou__ Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . __eou__ Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . __eou__ Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? __eou__ Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? __eou__ I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . __eou__ Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . __eou__ I guess that you will really be dressing down . __eou__ That's my style when I'm not in the office . __eou__ Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles . __eou__
I love your bracelet . When did you get it ? __eou__ I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ? __eou__ Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? __eou__ It's white gold . __eou__ Where did you buy it ? __eou__ My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . __eou__ That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? __eou__ That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . __eou__ You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . __eou__ My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . __eou__ What do you want ? __eou__ I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . __eou__ Why not a ring ? __eou__ I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet . __eou__ But you're ready for everything else ? __eou__ Akha . __eou__
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . __eou__ I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . __eou__ That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ? __eou__ No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop . __eou__ What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ? __eou__ Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least . __eou__ That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion . __eou__ Let's try it ! __eou__
Guess what I just heard ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ The boss is planning to sell the company . __eou__ You must be joking ! __eou__
Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ? __eou__ If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln . __eou__ He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ? __eou__ That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . __eou__ That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . __eou__ And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . __eou__ He had great vision , didn't he ? __eou__ And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . __eou__
Jack , could you check your calendar ? __eou__ Sure , what's going on ? __eou__ We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . __eou__ Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . __eou__
What sports do you like to play ? __eou__ I like baseball and basketball . __eou__ How about football ? __eou__ In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . __eou__ It's a very popular game in America . __eou__ Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? __eou__ For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ Are you a football player ? __eou__ No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ I see . It's safer then right ? __eou__ Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . __eou__ I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Great . __eou__
There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ What are the movies that are playing ? __eou__ There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon . __eou__ I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it . __eou__ So , is that a yes ? __eou__ Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? __eou__ It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main . __eou__ Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! __eou__
Hello , this is David . __eou__ Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? __eou__ Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? __eou__ That will work . __eou__ Does five thirty work for you ? __eou__ That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . __eou__ Is it the plans for my new house ? __eou__ Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . __eou__
There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . __eou__ What kind of food will they be serving ? __eou__ My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo . __eou__ It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food . __eou__ I can hardly wait ! __eou__ Do you know the day they plan to open ? __eou__ I'll double check the announcement . __eou__ Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ? __eou__
I'll see you in Sterlet , then . __eou__ Where did you say ? __eou__ Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y . __eou__ Right . __eou__
Hello . Are you a friend of Helen's ? __eou__ Actually , a friend of a friend . __eou__ My name is Phil . What's yours ? __eou__ Alecia . __eou__ Have you tried these little ditties ? They are really good . __eou__ Thanks . They look delicious . __eou__ Can I get you some punch ? I was just going to go get myself some . __eou__ That would be great . I would love some . __eou__
What date is today ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? __eou__ I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? __eou__ Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend . __eou__ It's not too late . Go to buy some now . __eou__
Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ? __eou__ My grandmother just passed away . __eou__ I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ? __eou__ A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral . __eou__ Is there anything I can do ? __eou__ No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time . __eou__ I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ? __eou__ Yeah . She died in her sleep . __eou__ I'm sorry she's gone . __eou__ At least she didn't suffer . __eou__ I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together . __eou__ I know . But I miss her . __eou__ When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said . __eou__ Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks . __eou__ It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat . __eou__ You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go . __eou__
How do you think about our boss ? __eou__ He's the nicest boss I've had . __eou__ Yes , I think he's the most relaxing person in management . __eou__ What's more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! __eou__ That's good . Maybe you'll get promoted . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? __eou__ Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . __eou__ Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ? __eou__ Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . __eou__ So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? __eou__ Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties . __eou__
I could get along fine without all the office politics . __eou__ What's going on ? __eou__ There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . __eou__ So what does that have to do with this position ? __eou__ Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . __eou__ All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . __eou__
What was the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It was a foreign film called ' Gone with the wind ' . __eou__ Really ? I've seen that movie , too . __eou__ How did you like the movie ? __eou__ I thought it was pretty good . __eou__ I can't say I agree . __eou__ You're kidding . The storyline and acting were outstanding . __eou__ I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . __eou__ It might be . __eou__
What is the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . __eou__ But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . __eou__ Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . __eou__ My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . __eou__ I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . __eou__ Let's go . The time is coming . __eou__ We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight ? __eou__ Sure . There is a folk concert tonight . __eou__ Are there any good seats left ? __eou__ Sorry . There are only some seats in the back . __eou__ Well , what time does it begin ? __eou__ It begins at 7 p . m .. __eou__ OK . I see . __eou__ How many tickets do you want ? __eou__ Just two . __eou__ OK . Fifty yuan for each . __eou__ Here is the money . __eou__
How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ? __eou__ Don ’ t be kidding , OK ? __eou__ What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you . __eou__ Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over . __eou__
Do you like cooking ? __eou__ Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . __eou__ Why do you like it ? __eou__ I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . __eou__ That's wonderful ! __eou__ And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . __eou__ Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Do you like ethnic food ? __eou__ I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian . __eou__ Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ? __eou__ I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ? __eou__ I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it . __eou__ Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , he gave me this address . __eou__ Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! __eou__
It sure is hot today . __eou__ That's for sure . I feel like I'm melting . __eou__
My brother joined the army last year . __eou__ Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? __eou__ He's tall and strong . __eou__ I can tell it from your build . __eou__
Where are you going for your trip ? __eou__ I think Hebes is a good place . __eou__ But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds . __eou__ How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ? __eou__ The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . __eou__ It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody ! __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by . __eou__ Come on in . Would you care for a drink ? __eou__ That sounds refreshing . Thanks ! __eou__
Good afternoon , Sam . __eou__ Good afternoon , Tina . __eou__ What are you going to do tomorrow ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . And you ? __eou__ I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ? __eou__ Is skating interesting ? __eou__ I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable . __eou__ But I can't skate well . __eou__ It doesn't matter , I can teach you . __eou__ It's very kind of you . __eou__
Look , that bamboo groves are flourishing . Let's go and play there . __eou__ Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ? __eou__ ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in . __eou__ Then we'd better not go . __eou__ OK . __eou__
You don't look too well . What's going on ? __eou__ I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ? __eou__ I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . __eou__ That's tough . What does your wife think about this ? __eou__ She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well . __eou__ I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do . __eou__ I really appreciate your help . __eou__ No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this . __eou__
Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing planned . How about you ? __eou__ Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink . __eou__ I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too . __eou__ I say we get drunk tonight . I don't want to think about all this stuff . __eou__ But we have to work tomorrow . __eou__ We won't stay out too late . I just need to forget about work . __eou__ I hear ya . Let's do it . __eou__
It's one of the highlights of the match . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The wonderful passing Melaena did . __eou__ Too bad I missed it . __eou__
I hope the host team loses . __eou__ That all depends on how the visiting team shapes . __eou__ According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America . __eou__ But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . __eou__
I hear you're going to Tainan to visit your uncle . __eou__ That's correct . __eou__ Well , say hello to him for me . __eou__
Can you tell which team seems to win ? __eou__ Hard to say . Now the score is in our favor . __eou__ Yes . Our guest team is really tough . __eou__ They're still fighting hard . Let's wait and see . __eou__
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . __eou__ They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . __eou__ If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . __eou__ No way , if it still has 21 . __eou__
It's quiet everywhere in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like winter . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go ! __eou__ What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . __eou__ Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . __eou__ I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . __eou__ Yes . Very wonderful . __eou__ There is a snowman over there . __eou__ How lovely it is ! __eou__
In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . __eou__ Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . __eou__ Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . __eou__ That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . __eou__ I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . __eou__ In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . __eou__ And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! __eou__ Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like taking photos . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , look at the photos I took . __eou__ They are beautiful . You did a good job . __eou__ Thank you for saying so . __eou__ As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . __eou__
Hello ! __eou__ Oh , hi ! __eou__ Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . __eou__ Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? __eou__ Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? __eou__ No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? __eou__ I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? __eou__ I am an accountant at a company . __eou__ Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . __eou__ It's nice meeting you too , Alice . __eou__ See you around ! __eou__ Goodbye , Alice . __eou__
Steve . Is that you ? __eou__ Yeah . What's going on ? __eou__ Not much . What a surprise to see you here . __eou__ Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you . __eou__ What have you been up to ? __eou__ I just started working out . __eou__ Really ? Where do you work out at ? __eou__ I joined the Samsung Health Club last month . __eou__ What do you mostly do during your workout ? __eou__ I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach . __eou__ I should start exercising more . __eou__ It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done . __eou__ I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it . __eou__ Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising . __eou__ If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym . __eou__ I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend . __eou__ Great . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Aright . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ Ok . Bye . __eou__
Do you like playing table tennis ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ When did you start it ? __eou__ Several years ago . __eou__
Welcome , Li Mei . Please give me your coat and hat . __eou__ Thank you , Peter . __eou__ Oh , let's come in and enjoy yourself . __eou__ Happy birthday , Peter , and many happy returns of the day .

Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic . __eou__ Of course not .

I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China . __eou__ Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival . __eou__ Why are you celebrating this festival ? __eou__ We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan . __eou__ What do you do on that day ? __eou__ We'll have rice dumplings .

What do you think of this suit ? Do I look good or what ? __eou__ You look great ! However , I think you are a little over dressed for dinner . __eou__ Didn't they say we're going to the Ritz ? __eou__ Yes , but not the Ritz Carlton , the " Ritz " is a pizza place with peanut shells on the floor . __eou__ In that case , let me make a quick change into my street clothes . __eou__ I'll wait right here for you Superman . __eou__ Ta da !

You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ? __eou__ Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__
Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ? __eou__ OK , I ’ Ve been looking for a job for days , and I haven ’ t found one yet . It's so hard finding work these days . Have you had any luck ? __eou__ Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant . __eou__ Are you well paid ? __eou__ Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss . __eou__ There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job . __eou__ That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot . __eou__ Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me . __eou__ Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know . __eou__ First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' __eou__ Be a yes-man , you mean ? __eou__ You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem . __eou__ I hope not . __eou__
So Emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ? __eou__ Well , what do you want to see ? I don't think there are many good movies out right now . __eou__ Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ? __eou__ Now that's a great plan . It's a date ! __eou__
I plan to emigrate to Canada . __eou__ Have you found a suitable job ? __eou__ No . But it is said the welfare in Canada is very good . __eou__ But as to me finding a good job is the most important thing . __eou__ Maybe you are right , so I will try my best to find a suitable job . __eou__

Bourbon with iced water . __eou__ Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ? __eou__ The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars . __eou__ That is OK . Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__
What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? __eou__ I'm planing to go bowling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? __eou__ I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how it goes . __eou__
Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ? __eou__ That's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them . __eou__ Matinee or evening ? __eou__ Evening . __eou__ Circle or stalls ? __eou__ Stalls . __eou__ Wonderful , I'll go with you . __eou__
Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ? __eou__ That would be fine . Where are you going ? __eou__ We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing . __eou__ Great . __eou__ And don't forget your fishing tackle . __eou__ Ok . I like fishing very much . __eou__
What did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ What else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! __eou__ To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? __eou__ Certainly , where will you be coming from ? __eou__ I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . __eou__ Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . __eou__ Got that . __eou__ Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . __eou__ Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? __eou__ No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . __eou__ Ok , I can see that road . __eou__ That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library . __eou__ Good , I can see the library on the map . __eou__ Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ? __eou__ That's great , see you at seven . __eou__
Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? __eou__ Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . __eou__ I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . __eou__ They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . __eou__ Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? __eou__ She is certainly not my kind of girl . __eou__ Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . __eou__ You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . __eou__ I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' __eou__
I hear you are expecting your family . __eou__ Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . __eou__ I didn't know you had a brother . __eou__ Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . __eou__ Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? __eou__ His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . __eou__ Does your brother have just one son ? __eou__ No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . __eou__ I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . __eou__ Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . __eou__ So when are they all coming ? __eou__ My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . __eou__
What are you doing tomorrow ? __eou__ Nothing really . __eou__ Let's watch a movie or something . __eou__ What's on these days ? __eou__ I think they're playing Lord of the Rings __eou__ That sounds pretty good . Let's watch that . __eou__ Where should we meet ? __eou__ How about at the subway entrance . __eou__ Aright . I'll meet you there at one o'clock . __eou__
Did you see Ally Mabel last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Did you ? __eou__ Yes , wasn't it funny ? __eou__ Oh yes , I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ? __eou__ Ha , yes , brilliant ! __eou__
So Beth , what kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ I listen to a lot of hip hop . What about you ? __eou__ I mostly listen to pop music , but I like a lot of different stuff . __eou__ Yes , me too . I mostly listen to hip hop , but there are many genres of music I like . __eou__
Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus . __eou__ I know ! It's gonna be great . But what kind of music do you think we should play ? __eou__ That's a good question . You know I love hip hop , so maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs . __eou__ Hmm ... Vanilla Ice ? I know his most famous song , " Ice Ice Baby , " but I don't know his other songs . __eou__ That's OK . You can buy his songs on iTunes and listen to them . __eou__
What about you , Emily ? Have you dated anyone recently ? __eou__ I started to date someone recently , but it didn't work out . __eou__ That's too bad . What happened ? __eou__ Well ... that's a long story . __eou__
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . __eou__
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . __eou__ Oh , do you go hiking often ? __eou__ I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . __eou__ It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? __eou__ Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? __eou__ Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . __eou__ Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . __eou__ Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . __eou__ Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . __eou__ Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . __eou__
How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . __eou__ Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? __eou__ No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow night . __eou__
Are you busy with your work ? __eou__ Yes . What about you ? __eou__ Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime . __eou__ Then your salary must be high . __eou__ Just so so . But we can travel twice every year . __eou__ Is this time one of them ? __eou__ Yes , we won't travel again until October . __eou__ Really ? We have only one chance every year . __eou__
Nice day , isn't it ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ It's a good day for a picnic . __eou__
Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ? __eou__ I'm at home painting . __eou__ I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ? __eou__ I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college . __eou__ That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby . __eou__ Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it . __eou__ I think I will . Thanks for the info . __eou__
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute . __eou__ Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ? __eou__ Thanks . Gee , it's really light ! __eou__ Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ? __eou__ I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look . __eou__ Wow , that's really old . __eou__ Yes , I like collecting antiques . __eou__ Why don't you get a new one ? __eou__ I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . __eou__ Really , what makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? __eou__ Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . __eou__ Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? __eou__ Three . Two boys and a girl . __eou__
It's snowing outside . __eou__ Oh , how could it be ? __eou__ Let's go out and have a look . __eou__ OK . Wait a minute . __eou__ Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . __eou__ Yes . It's really snowing . __eou__ I love winter , I love snow . __eou__ But don't you think it's a little too cold ? __eou__ But I like cold more than hot . __eou__ You are so interesting . __eou__
What do you do when you are angry ? __eou__ I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . __eou__ That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ? __eou__ Something like listening to music is a good idea . __eou__ Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ Classic . Something that could calm your mind . __eou__ I think that might work for me as well . __eou__ Working out is another good way to relieve anger . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk . __eou__
Life's so boring . __eou__ Well , most of the time it is , I guess . __eou__ What do you think will make you happy ? __eou__ I think money will make me happy . __eou__ You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness . __eou__ It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do . __eou__ You'll get bored eventually . __eou__ Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work . __eou__ That's true , I guess . If I didn't have to work , I think I would be happy . __eou__ You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities . __eou__
How old are you , Su ? __eou__ I am seven . __eou__ I see , you have seven candles on the cake . __eou__ Yes , I am seven . I am a big girl now . __eou__ We will have a party here , right ? __eou__ Yes , come on , and we will have fun . __eou__
Have you considered upgrading your system ? __eou__ Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . __eou__ You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . __eou__ That would be a definite bonus . __eou__ You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__ How can we do that ? __eou__ You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . __eou__ That sounds great . Thanks . __eou__
Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you . __eou__ Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . __eou__ Oh , thank you , Mary . You're so nice . __eou__ I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ? __eou__ They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon . __eou__ Let's go . __eou__
I think it's about time that we had to go . __eou__ What ? Won't you have more drinks ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time . __eou__ Oh ! I'm sorry , but I wish you could stay . __eou__ Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality . __eou__ Don't mention it . You can come whenever You are free . __eou__

Do you think the bad weather will last long ? __eou__ I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . __eou__ I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . __eou__ I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time . __eou__ Good idea . Thanks a billion . __eou__
I guess I'd better go now . __eou__ I've got to be going now too . __eou__ In that case , I'll be seeing you . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days . __eou__ Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you . __eou__ I hope it will be of some use to you . __eou__ I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far . __eou__ That will be great . __eou__
The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it . __eou__ Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ? __eou__ Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together . __eou__ Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year . __eou__ Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards . __eou__ What are the children doing ? __eou__ They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . __eou__ I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year . __eou__ Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money . __eou__ Who will get the money ? __eou__ Of course the children . __eou__
Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country . __eou__ Really ? He is so great . __eou__ You don't want to join him ? __eou__ Surely I want . It's quite popular nowadays . __eou__ Yes , and I want to have a try . __eou__
Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . __eou__ You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . __eou__ But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? __eou__ It's once in blue moon . __eou__ What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? __eou__ The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . __eou__
I hear you are moving to Dalian . __eou__ Yes . I found a very good job down here . __eou__ Well , we'll certainly miss you here . __eou__ I am going to miss you , too . __eou__ Let's keep in touch . __eou__ OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there . __eou__
How long have you been living in New York ? __eou__ Oh , about two years now . __eou__ Where do your parents live ? __eou__ They still live in Shanghai where I was born . __eou__ Do you write or call them very much ? __eou__ Yes , I try to keep in touch with them . __eou__
What are your plans for this weekend ? __eou__ I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday . __eou__ If the weather's fine . __eou__ I am sure it will be . It's been good so far this weekend . __eou__ I know a good place to hire bikes if you want . __eou__ Thanks . That would be really helpful . __eou__ But remember , be careful when you ride a bike . The traffic in Beijing can be dangerous . __eou__
I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right __eou__ I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . __eou__ Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? __eou__ In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . __eou__ So many ? __eou__ This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . __eou__ Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? __eou__ Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name . __eou__
Do you have any siblings ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I am the oldest child . I have a sister and a brother . My sister is in college and my brother in high school . __eou__ How do you get along with them ? __eou__ We get alone very well . __eou__
Judy , your husband has a really nice car . __eou__ Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ We're going to visit my sister in the city . __eou__ I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ? __eou__ About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library . __eou__ I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ? __eou__ Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway . __eou__ I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now . __eou__ Doesn't your mother live in the city ? __eou__ Yes , she's lived there for about ten years . __eou__ I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then . __eou__ I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now . __eou__ Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . __eou__ Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . __eou__ Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . __eou__ I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . __eou__
Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you . __eou__ Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much . __eou__ I am glad you like it . __eou__
Hey ! I have a surprise for you . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Open this card and read . __eou__ A trip to China for summer vacation . Wow ! What a wonderful surprise ! Thank you . This is the best surprise I've ever had . __eou__
I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . __eou__ Many thanks for your presence . __eou__
I hate computer games . __eou__ Why ? They are fine . __eou__ Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . __eou__ Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good . __eou__ If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . __eou__ Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games . __eou__
So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? __eou__ Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . __eou__ Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . __eou__ You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit . __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . __eou__
Did you hear Peter just retired ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__ He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__ Really ? He looks so young . __eou__
Two people were robbed last night near the park . __eou__ Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . __eou__ I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . __eou__ Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . __eou__ I Know . And you should be more careful , too . __eou__
There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . __eou__ It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . __eou__ Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . __eou__ It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . __eou__ But we need the wood . __eou__ But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood . __eou__
What a wonderful game ! __eou__ Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful . __eou__ I think John is the best player on the field . __eou__ He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage . __eou__ Maybe he shouldn ’ t come to collage , he should become a football star . __eou__
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__
You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . __eou__ No , thanks . I have had enough . __eou__ What about some drink ? __eou__ Please bring me a cup of coffee . __eou__
I visited the Polar Aquarium today . __eou__ Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? __eou__ Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them . __eou__ It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds . __eou__ Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days . __eou__ Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too . __eou__
Look , there are some words on the fish . __eou__ I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays . __eou__ For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? __eou__ Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic . __eou__ You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . __eou__ Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal . __eou__ Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? __eou__ OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? __eou__
My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ? __eou__ He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? __eou__ He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . __eou__ It must be hard being a father . __eou__ No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you . __eou__ Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day . __eou__
Does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? It's hot in here . __eou__ Actually , I prefer if you didn't . Air conditioning makes me sneeze . __eou__ All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ? __eou__ Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here . __eou__
Could you tell me the right time , please ? __eou__ Well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days . __eou__ You'll have to get it fixed . __eou__ Yes , I will . __eou__
What time is it , Tom ? __eou__ Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch . __eou__ Is it ? I had no idea it was so late . I must be off now . __eou__ What's the hurry ? __eou__ I must catch the nine-thirty train . __eou__ You've plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there . __eou__
Who is your favorite NBA star ? __eou__ Kobe Bryant , of course . __eou__ Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ Maybe he is not good at rebounding ? __eou__ Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__ Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ Well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . __eou__
You went out on a date last night , didn't you ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Why don't you phone her for a date again ? __eou__ I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me . __eou__ Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again . __eou__ I will . Thanks for your advice . __eou__
Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . __eou__ Hackneyed theme ! __eou__ What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? __eou__ Nearly everything . __eou__ You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? __eou__ Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . __eou__ Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s __eou__ Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . __eou__ Mm . What came after that ? __eou__ After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . __eou__ Pretty good . Please continue . __eou__ Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . __eou__ The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . __eou__ Come on . __eou__ Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . __eou__ Any more ? __eou__ Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . __eou__
I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion . __eou__ A magic love potion ? __eou__ Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . __eou__ It can't be true . __eou__ Take my word for it . __eou__ So what am I going to do ? __eou__ Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' __eou__ That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? __eou__ Don't be so shy , Lucy . __eou__
Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? __eou__ I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . __eou__ No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . __eou__ It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . __eou__ Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . __eou__ I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . __eou__ That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . __eou__ Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . __eou__
I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . __eou__ A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . __eou__ That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . __eou__ Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . __eou__ why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . __eou__ Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . __eou__ They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . __eou__ I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . __eou__ Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . __eou__ To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . __eou__ You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . __eou__ That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . __eou__ You really can't live without candy . __eou__
Do you know his sister ? __eou__ Her name is Laura , isn't it ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ How old is she ? __eou__ Um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , I can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . Tthat's it . __eou__ What does she look like ? __eou__ Well ... __eou__ Pretty , is she ? __eou__ Yes ... quite pretty . __eou__
My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . __eou__ It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . __eou__ But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? __eou__ It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . __eou__ What time is the right moment ? __eou__ Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . __eou__
What's your favorite hobby ? __eou__ I'd like reading books best . __eou__ What kinds of books do you like to read ? __eou__ Literature and economy . __eou__ By the way , would you like to see movies ? __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes . __eou__ I just like to sleep like a lazy cat . __eou__ That's a bad habit . __eou__
How many persons are there in your family ? __eou__ There are three , my parents and I . __eou__ Do you live together ? __eou__ No , I live alone in a flat near my work place . __eou__ Do you often go back to see your parents . __eou__ Yes , almost once a week . __eou__
Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ? __eou__ Why do you listen to rap ? __eou__ It's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much . __eou__ Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.You can dance to heavy metal . __eou__ Hey , you can dance to rap music ! __eou__ I can't dance to it . And I know you can't either . Because I've seen you try . __eou__
Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ? __eou__ What time do you open this evening ? __eou__ We open at 6:30 , sir . __eou__ I see .

I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . May I have your name , please ? __eou__ Davis . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Davis . __eou__ Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration . __eou__ I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand . __eou__ I do , but I would appreciate you , if it could be arranged . __eou__ We'll try our best . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I know you are a good dancer . What dances do you like ? __eou__ I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful . __eou__ Why do you like old styles of dance ? __eou__ Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ? __eou__ I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I don't like them . Why not ask Lily . She likes modern dance . __eou__ OK , I will.Thank you . __eou__
What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week . __eou__ Is the entrance charge expensive ? __eou__ Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . __eou__ Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? __eou__ You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . __eou__ You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . __eou__
I'd better be going . __eou__ So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I wish I could , but it's already late . __eou__ Oh , it's a pity that you have to leave . __eou__ Thank you for a wonderful meal . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoyed it . __eou__
How do you usually sell your products now ? __eou__ I'm doing business through Internet now . __eou__ Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? __eou__ Yes , very good . __eou__ What advantages does it have ? __eou__ It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time . __eou__ Yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . __eou__ Also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet , which is very cheap . __eou__ Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ? __eou__ To be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways . __eou__ You mean there may be credit problems ? __eou__ Yes , but if you choose some good B2B websites , such problems can be avoided . __eou__ Will you give some suggestion ? __eou__ Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website . __eou__ Thanks . Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future . __eou__
I'm better now . Want to play again ? __eou__ I'll let you break the balls this time . __eou__ Let's get all the balls out of the pockets . __eou__ OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ? __eou__ You are crazy . Gambling is against my principles . __eou__
These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . __eou__ Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions . __eou__ That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . __eou__ I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . __eou__
We are doing ' Secret Santa ' at the office again this year . __eou__ Whose name did you pick ? __eou__ I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ? __eou__ Booze ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . __eou__
What did you do last night ? __eou__ I just stayed at home and watched TV . __eou__ Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? __eou__ Yes , it was a very evenly matched game . __eou__ What were the results of the game ? __eou__ It ended in a tie . __eou__ What was the actual score ? __eou__ It was three all . __eou__ Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . __eou__ If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . __eou__ That explains it . __eou__ How many more games are left this season ? __eou__ That was the last game before the playoffs . __eou__ When do the playoffs start ? __eou__ In a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? __eou__ Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . __eou__ Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . __eou__ Sure , that would be great . __eou__ Ok , it's a date then ! __eou__
Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? __eou__ I don't think so . __eou__ How about going to a concert ? __eou__ That suits me fine . __eou__
So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? __eou__ Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? __eou__ I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . __eou__ Do you know anyone in the play ? __eou__ Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . __eou__ Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__ That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . __eou__ So you've seen other plays that he's directed ? __eou__ Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? __eou__ I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? __eou__ I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . __eou__ That sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . __eou__
Have a nice weekend ! __eou__ Thanks.You too ! __eou__ Do you have any plans ? __eou__ Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? __eou__ Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . __eou__
How do you like these dishes ? __eou__ Fine , they are colorful and tasty . __eou__ Did you enjoy your dinner ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . __eou__ Would you like some more rice ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm full . __eou__ Another piece of meat pie ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm on diet . __eou__ How about the dessert ? __eou__ Ice cream , please . __eou__
Happy Mother's Day , Mom ! __eou__ Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! __eou__ Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__ I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . __eou__
May I know how old you are ? __eou__ I am 24 . __eou__ What is your date of birth ? __eou__ I was born on April 15 , 1986 . __eou__
I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert . __eou__ How about going to the theatre ? __eou__ I don't like going to the theatre . __eou__ Well , what do you like doing ? __eou__ Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? __eou__ I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . __eou__ I like talking to you , too . __eou__ Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__
I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? __eou__ Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team . __eou__ Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? __eou__ Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . __eou__ Could you move smoothly ? __eou__ Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . __eou__ What happened afterwards ? __eou__ I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . __eou__ Poor girl ! __eou__
Lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ? __eou__ OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? __eou__ Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library . __eou__ Are we going to walk or drive ? __eou__ The weather is really nice today . Let's walk . __eou__ The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon . __eou__ Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ? __eou__ No , he's still sleeping . __eou__ Wow , it's already 10:00 AM . He must have been up late last night . __eou__ Yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 AM . __eou__ I hope he can come later . __eou__ I hope so too . I'll give him a call when we get there . __eou__ How do we get to the library from here ? __eou__ It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes . __eou__
Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 . __eou__ It's 8 sharp by my watch . __eou__ Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go . __eou__
Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight . __eou__ Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans . __eou__ I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ? __eou__ OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye . __eou__ Good-bye . __eou__
Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ? __eou__ Sounds good , when ? __eou__ When is it convenient for you ? __eou__ Any time is fine . __eou__ Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ? __eou__ Please wait for us even if we're a little late . __eou__ Never mind . I'll be waiting for you . __eou__ See you then . __eou__ OK . Bye ! __eou__
May I have a word with you ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ When will you be free ? __eou__ Come by any time . __eou__ Shall I say around ten o'clock ? __eou__ Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 . __eou__
Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . __eou__ A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . __eou__ Do you like him ? __eou__ Yes , I do like him . __eou__ Then why are you hesitating ? __eou__ You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . __eou__ One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ? __eou__ Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . __eou__ Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? __eou__ She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . __eou__ Do you believe her excuse ? __eou__ Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . __eou__ Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . __eou__ Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend . __eou__
May I invite you to dance with me ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't dance . __eou__ Never mind , I can teach you . __eou__ Is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ No , it is easy . __eou__ How should I do ? __eou__ You just follow me . __eou__ All right . By the way , do you often dance ? __eou__ Yup , because dance can relax myself . __eou__ It seems a good way . __eou__
Have you enjoyed your weekend ? __eou__ Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble . __eou__ Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha . __eou__
Did you say that Ted was at your mercy ? __eou__ Sort of yes . __eou__ But he is not someone who can be led by the nose . __eou__ But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Hi . __eou__ How are you ? __eou__ I'm good . How are you ? __eou__ Good . Do you speak English ? __eou__ A little . Are you American ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from California . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you too . __eou__

Do you like spaghetti ? __eou__ No , I don't , but I like pizza . __eou__
I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else . __eou__ They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness . __eou__ But many rich guys don ’ t think they are truly happy . There is always some empty feeling deep inside them . __eou__
Charlotte , have you had your supper ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . __eou__ Why ? Don't you feel well ? __eou__ I ’ m down in spirits . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ My manager jumped on me for my mistake today . __eou__ You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing . __eou__ I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well . __eou__ You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done . __eou__ But I doubt myself . __eou__ Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . __eou__
Someone ’ s told me behind closed door that he is very hot-tempered . __eou__ I ’ m afraid what you were told is not quite right , if you could meet him in person , and you ’ ll know he ’ s very agreeable and capable . __eou__ Really ? I hope to meet him soon . __eou__
I haven't seen Bill lately . How is he ? __eou__ He's still pretty sick . __eou__ That's too bad . What does he have ? __eou__ We don't know , but he's going to the doctor tomorrow . __eou__ Let me know if there's anything I can do . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I'll tell him . __eou__
How's your brother doing ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , he hasn't been feeling too well . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . What's the matter ? __eou__ Tell him I hope he's better soon . __eou__ I'll tell him . Thanks for asking about him . __eou__

How old are you ? __eou__ I'm 32 . __eou__
I think it's going to be a nice day . __eou__ It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday . __eou__ But it'supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon . __eou__ Well , the worst of the winter should be over . __eou__
What is today ? __eou__ Thursday . __eou__ So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__
What time is it by your watch ? __eou__ I'm sorry , my watch has stopped . __eou__ It's 2:42 by my watch . But it moves a bit fast . __eou__ Let's ask someone else . __eou__
Oh , the ink is spilled on the desk . __eou__ Did it spill on your clothes ? __eou__ No , but the table cloth was dirty . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain . __eou__ It's no big deal . __eou__ I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you . __eou__ Don't be silly , forget about it . __eou__
Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? __eou__ Yes , that is why I never drink it . __eou__ Do you drink green tea , then ? __eou__ Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . __eou__ But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . __eou__ What good is it for ? __eou__ Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . __eou__ That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . __eou__ Why is it so ? __eou__ Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . __eou__
Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? __eou__ Which one will you be going to ? __eou__ We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . __eou__ Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . __eou__ I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . __eou__ OK , can I bring a date with me ? __eou__ Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . __eou__ Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . __eou__ Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . __eou__ I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? __eou__ Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . __eou__ I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . __eou__ One last question.Is there a dress code there ? __eou__ No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home . __eou__ Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight . __eou__ I'll see you there at 9pm . __eou__ Okay . See you then . __eou__
Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I've got to write a term paper . It will be due by this Thursday . __eou__ You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest . __eou__ I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ? __eou__ Just take it easy . Come on with me . __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I can't go with you . Shall we find some other time ? __eou__
Susan , Did you know the four ugliest women in ancient China ? __eou__ No , I only know four great beauties of China . __eou__ There were some famous ugly women in history . __eou__ Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ? __eou__ Though they were ugly , they had great virtue . __eou__ Then who were they ? __eou__ Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . __eou__ It seems that the inner beauty is also important . __eou__ Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . __eou__
Do you like tea ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't know much about it . __eou__ Tea does good to people's health . There are many kinds of tea.Say , black tea , green tea , scented tea , brick tea , milk tea , Jas - mine tea , chrysanthemum tea and so on . __eou__ My favourite is Jasmine tea . I like its aroma . __eou__ Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion . __eou__
Hey , Joshua ! Is Anny coming with us ? __eou__ Yes , why ? __eou__ Nothing . I'm just asking . __eou__ Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Aha , someone has a crush on Anny , doesn't he ? __eou__ Who has a crush ? __eou__ Come on , Josh , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . __eou__ I'd totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! __eou__
At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! __eou__ Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . __eou__ Do you know any secrets to China's success ? __eou__ In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . __eou__ So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . __eou__ Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . __eou__ Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! __eou__ Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . __eou__
When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ? __eou__ Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister . __eou__ Well ... How about Friday then ? __eou__ That sounds fine . __eou__ Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ? __eou__ I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ? __eou__ That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you . __eou__ I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday ! __eou__
I finally went out to dinner with him last night . __eou__ Just the two of you ? __eou__ Yup . __eou__ Where did you go ? __eou__ True , a sea food restaurant . __eou__ True ? The food is terrible . __eou__ I didn't notice . I don't really even know what I ate . __eou__ Really ? __eou__
How come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? __eou__ I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . __eou__ As far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? __eou__ Well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__ You're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__ You're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? __eou__ Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . __eou__ I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! __eou__ You need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__ You ’ re right . I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . __eou__ Besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! __eou__ Good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! __eou__
Is this your brother-in-law ? __eou__ Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . __eou__ From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . __eou__ Yes , my sister loves his personality . __eou__

Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? __eou__ I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . __eou__ Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . __eou__ Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . __eou__ It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . __eou__ But it's really exciting . __eou__ Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . __eou__ Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . __eou__ Yep . __eou__ I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . __eou__ Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . __eou__
Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! __eou__ Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . __eou__ Sure . Meet me at five . __eou__

Hey , what's the matter ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . __eou__ Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__
How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? __eou__ Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films . __eou__ We could find a classical one . __eou__ That sounds fine . __eou__
How did you spend the weekend ? __eou__ I went to a movie with my boyfriend . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? __eou__ Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? __eou__ The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . __eou__ Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . __eou__ It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . __eou__

I like their generic brand . __eou__ I have been using the store across town for years . __eou__ I hear they have very nice stuff . __eou__ They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . __eou__ Well , you should try my store . The prices are good . __eou__ I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . __eou__
What are you doing now , Steven ? __eou__ I am reading a book about money management . __eou__ Oh , my God . Do you want to be a millionaire ? I can see you are very crazy about money . __eou__ Everyone wants to earn a lot of money . Don't you think so ? What's more , I am interested in money management . __eou__ No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life . __eou__ Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go .

Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 . __eou__ That sounds fine . __eou__
How about you , Chuck ? Where did you grow up ? __eou__ Well , I was born in Ohio , but I grew up in Texas . __eou__ And when did you come to Los Angeles ? __eou__ In 1978 . I went to college here . __eou__ Oh . What was your major ? __eou__ Drama . I was an actor for five years after college . __eou__ That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ? __eou__ Because I needed the money . And because I was good at it . Look ! What do you think ? __eou__
Hi , Celia ! How was your trip to the United States ? __eou__ It was terrific . I really enjoyed it . __eou__ Great . How long were you away ? __eou__ I was there for about three weeks . __eou__ That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ? __eou__ Yes , most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago . __eou__ So , what was the best thing about your trip ? __eou__ Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best . __eou__
How are you feeling , John ? __eou__ Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed . __eou__ Do more exercises after you are healthy . __eou__ Ok , I will .

What did you say ? __eou__ I said he was nothing but a yeoman . __eou__ Then he become angry with you ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
It's said that John's broken up . __eou__ Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . __eou__ I hear that John's leading a double wife . __eou__ It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . __eou__
Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man . __eou__ Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior . __eou__ If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver . __eou__ OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . __eou__
How do you like Tom ? __eou__ I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog . __eou__ Are you ready to welcome him ? __eou__ I am all set . He can come anytime . __eou__
How is he ? __eou__ Not very well . He was white about the gills . __eou__ Did he see the doctor ? __eou__ Yeah , but he refused to take the medicine . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I don't know the reason . __eou__
What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I am not sure . What are you doing ? __eou__ I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . __eou__ That sounds like a great idea ! __eou__ Would you be interested in joining me ? __eou__ Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ? __eou__ I thought that we could leave around 8 __eou__ That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? __eou__ That was part of my plan . __eou__ Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you . __eou__
Hi , I haven't seen you in a while . __eou__ Yes , it has been a long time ! __eou__ How long has it been since we last saw each other ? __eou__ I think that we last saw each other two years ago . __eou__ What have you been doing for the past two years ? __eou__ I have been going to graduate school at USC . __eou__ What are you majoring in ? __eou__ I am studying international communications . __eou__ You should easily be able to find a job with that major . __eou__ I am counting on being able to get a good job . __eou__

Sit down , please.How are you ? __eou__ I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? __eou__ Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? __eou__ Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ What's the weather like in your country ? __eou__ Mm ... It's quite warm now . __eou__ Where do you live ? __eou__ In London.Where do you live ? __eou__ Here.Near this school . __eou__
Look at the cloud . __eou__ It's going to rain . __eou__ Let's go quickly . __eou__
I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad , Where can you park around here ? __eou__ There is a square in front of us . We can park the car there . __eou__ Is a shop there ? __eou__ I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too . __eou__
How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America ? __eou__ Oh , I make a phone call once a month . __eou__ It's very expensive , right ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why not send E-mail through the Internet ? __eou__ Is it convenient and cheap ? __eou__ Sure . You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too . __eou__ Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ? __eou__ No problem . I'll tell you . __eou__ I'll appreciate it very much . __eou__
Has the chief accepted our plan ? __eou__ Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . __eou__ Let ’ s have a try . __eou__
Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? __eou__ Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? __eou__ Ok that sounds good .

Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ? __eou__ Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday . __eou__ Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays . __eou__ Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays . __eou__ So there are only five working days in a week ? __eou__ Right . What are you going to do tonight ? __eou__ I'm going to study . __eou__ On a Friday night ? __eou__ Well , I need to polish up my English . __eou__

Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . __eou__
How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? __eou__ We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . __eou__ Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . __eou__ But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . __eou__
I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . __eou__ He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . __eou__ If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__
You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps . __eou__
Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know . __eou__ I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . __eou__
I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ Because he is often in trouble . __eou__ She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
It is too bad today . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . __eou__ How did you find him at last ? __eou__ It was the police wo helped me to do that . __eou__ It must have taught you a lesson this time . __eou__
What's this , I wonder ? __eou__ I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . __eou__ A coffee grinder ? __eou__ Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . __eou__ Oh , that would be very useful . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . __eou__
Well , everything is packed and ready to go . __eou__ It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . __eou__ Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - __eou__ And the people were so friendly ! __eou__ Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . __eou__ Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? __eou__ Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . __eou__ I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . __eou__ If only we could eat there once more ! __eou__ Maybe we can come here again next summer . __eou__ Hope the restaurant is still there . __eou__ Hey , what's the time ? __eou__ Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now . __eou__ Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright . __eou__
I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . __eou__ Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones . __eou__ I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance . __eou__ It seems you have to take time . __eou__
Why are you walking to and fro in the room ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups . __eou__ I know . But I couldn ’ t help . __eou__
John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? __eou__ Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . __eou__ I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered . __eou__
So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ? __eou__ Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . __eou__ Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . __eou__ Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can . __eou__ Ok , I ’ ll try my best . __eou__
Have you been to Shanghai before ? __eou__ Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . __eou__ That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? __eou__ No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . __eou__ So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! __eou__
How did you meet your boyfriend , Cindy ? __eou__ We were in the same science class last term . __eou__ Who made the first move ? __eou__ I did . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ It was no big deal . __eou__ What do your parents think of your dating a boy ? __eou__ They're glad that I finally got a boyfriend . __eou__ They're glad ? ! __eou__
What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! __eou__ You're right . I love going out and making new friends . __eou__ So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__
What's that book you have under your arm ? __eou__ It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . __eou__ How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . __eou__ I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . __eou__ Is it really worth paying for ? __eou__ I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . __eou__ If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . __eou__
My son closed his ear to what I said . I don ’ t know what I should do . __eou__ You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . __eou__ I cannot have the heart to do that . __eou__
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
Can you tell me a little about Paris ? __eou__ Sure . What do you expect to know ? __eou__ I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower , the Seine River ... __eou__ And you shouldn't miss the Louvre Museum . You can stay there for at least a whole day . __eou__ That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? __eou__ The night life there . It's so romantic ! __eou__ Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ? __eou__ I went there in August , and it was hot . But I was told autumn is the best season . __eou__ Sounds exciting . I can't wait . __eou__
So John , have you ever been to China before ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t . This is the first time I have been to China . __eou__ Have you travelled to many other countries ? __eou__ To be honest , I have never been to an Asian country before but I have visited many countries in Europe . __eou__ What about America ? Have you ever been to the United States ? __eou__ Actually , I haven ’ t been to the states but I have been to Canada . __eou__
The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . __eou__ That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . __eou__ Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . __eou__ Do you prefer brandy or ports . __eou__ Port , please . __eou__ Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . __eou__ The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? __eou__ Yes . You always have a good nose for wines . __eou__ Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . __eou__ Oh , what's that ? __eou__ It's made from naturally frozen grapes . __eou__ Why not ? It sounds great . __eou__ OK , here's to your health . __eou__ Thanks . Cheers . __eou__ Cheers . __eou__
What does your sister look like , Mike ? __eou__ Well , she ’ s tall and pretty . __eou__ Is she like you ? __eou__ I suppose so . We ’ re both friendly and easy-going . __eou__ Is she as clever as you ? __eou__ No , she ’ s not as clever as me . __eou__ Big head ! __eou__
I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain . __eou__ You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall . __eou__ I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child __eou__ Your dream will come true . It's really breathtaking __eou__
Do you want black or white coffee ? __eou__ White , please __eou__ Look ! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening . Do you Want to go ? __eou__ I don't like Folk music very much . __eou__ What kind of music do you like ? __eou__ I like classical music . Do you ? __eou__ Not very much . Classical music sends me to sleep __eou__ I don't believe you . __eou__ It ’ s true . __eou__ You are funny ! __eou__ So are you ! How about another coffee ? __eou__
Good evening . I've come to see Miss Morrison __eou__ Oh ! Good evening . I'm sorry , but she is not in . She's gone out to the theatre __eou__ Oh ! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents __eou__ Please come in __eou__ But you're busy , aren't you ? __eou__ I was preparing my supper but I've finished now . __eou__ I can leave the parcel with you , can't I ? __eou__ Oh ! yes __eou__
Jack and Mary broke up . __eou__ It ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? __eou__ Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? __eou__ No , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . __eou__ Maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ He is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . __eou__ Poor Mary ! She really liked him . __eou__ Anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . __eou__ Do you think they ’ ll get back together ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . __eou__ I hope she ’ ll recover soon . __eou__ So do I . __eou__
This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes , I mean it . __eou__ But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? __eou__ No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . __eou__ Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . __eou__ I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . __eou__ But I still love you . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . __eou__ I knew this would happen some day ... __eou__ Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? __eou__ Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... __eou__ I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . __eou__ I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . __eou__ I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . __eou__ Shall we keep pur friendship ? __eou__ Sure , let ’ s just be friends . __eou__
Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . __eou__ What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . __eou__ Then what shall we do ? __eou__ Call the police . __eou__
I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . __eou__ I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . __eou__ Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . __eou__ And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . __eou__
I learned of the railway accident only this morning . __eou__ A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . __eou__ Is that true ? __eou__ Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__

You married Joe , didn't you ? __eou__ Joe ? I don't know what you mean . __eou__ I remember you are in love . __eou__ Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . __eou__ It's Greek to me . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ Yeah . He has no one to count on . __eou__
May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . __eou__ Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . __eou__ Poor John ! He is bettering bother sides of this bread . __eou__ This situation isn't easy to handle . __eou__
Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__ But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . __eou__
Hi , what ’ re you reading ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? __eou__ No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished . __eou__ Sure . I didn ’ t know you liked mysteries . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . __eou__

Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__ Why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__ I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__ I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__ I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . __eou__
How did Jim get the money ? __eou__ He borrowed it from Nick . __eou__ He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . __eou__ He was too desperate to find some other way . __eou__
I don ’ t know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has louse up my business several times . __eou__ You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . __eou__
What ? You golden watch is lost ? __eou__ Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . __eou__ It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . __eou__ Let's get it back . __eou__

Judy , what is everybody talking about ? __eou__ Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . __eou__ Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised . __eou__ Me too . __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ what a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree . __eou__ I am sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
Um , which of them is the better typist ? __eou__ Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . __eou__ Is there any difference in their short hand ? __eou__ Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . __eou__ How about languages ? __eou__ Both of them speak excellent French .

I think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ I think so too . It's just pointless . __eou__ Then why are so many guys so crazy about it ? __eou__ I don't know . Maybe they're really crazy . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__

Hello , Deva , how are you ? __eou__ Can't complain . What about you ? __eou__ Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? __eou__ I've heard . She looks quite depressed . __eou__ Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ Yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ Yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ That's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__

I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
I ’ m fed up with marriage . __eou__ Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife . __eou__ Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time . __eou__ But now you are rich . __eou__ And we have some squabbles on some boring things . __eou__ This is ordinary marriage life . __eou__
He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife . __eou__ Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent . __eou__ I don ’ t understand . __eou__ He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him . __eou__
There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . __eou__ What is a tornado warning ? __eou__ It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . __eou__ Really ? In New Berlin ? __eou__ No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__ I understand . They think a tornado might come . __eou__ Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . __eou__ And the second stage is called a tornado warning . __eou__ Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__ It's scary . __eou__ Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__ What do you mean a loud train ? __eou__ That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . __eou__ But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? __eou__ Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . __eou__ Have you seen a lot of them ? __eou__ I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . __eou__ Did it hit their house ? __eou__ No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . __eou__ What were they doing when you called ? __eou__ They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . __eou__ That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? __eou__ Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . __eou__

They've got good ones now . __eou__ It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get . __eou__ Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now.You ' d feel so good driving a new car . __eou__ Let's look at them all.Have you got a paper there ? __eou__
It's a fine day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . __eou__ How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . __eou__ I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . __eou__ Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . __eou__ You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . __eou__ The weatherman predicts a fine day today . __eou__ The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . __eou__
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the weather sure is nice today . __eou__ I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . __eou__ I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . __eou__ Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . __eou__ Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . __eou__ If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . __eou__
Hey , did you hear the news ? __eou__ No , what's up ? __eou__ Miss Yang is dating the manager who's married . __eou__ You're joking ! __eou__ No joke ! That's why she hasn't married yet . __eou__
Do you want a cigarette ? __eou__ No , thank you . I've given up , you know . __eou__ You don't mind if I have one . __eou__ Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ Why don't you try and give it up ? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no use . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect . __eou__
I want to meet you . Are you free this evening ? __eou__ Well , actually , I'm not free today . Do you have anything urgent ? __eou__ No , I just want to meet you . __eou__ How about tomorrow instead . __eou__ Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? __eou__ All right . See you then . __eou__
What's the bonus like at your company ? __eou__ Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . __eou__ Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible ! __eou__ Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . __eou__ Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . __eou__ Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . __eou__ What did you buy ? __eou__ A new home health monitor . __eou__ Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ No joke ! __eou__ That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . __eou__
I think your speech was excellent . __eou__ Was it ? __eou__ Sure it was . __eou__ Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know . __eou__ But you did it and did it well ! __eou__
We can't wait any longer ... __eou__ I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... __eou__ You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? __eou__ I can't afford to . __eou__ All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? __eou__ Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . __eou__ Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well . __eou__ Sorry , I'll try to speak louder . __eou__
Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? __eou__ What ’ s it for ? __eou__ It ’ s for a book . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . __eou__ Really ? Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you , Paul . __eou__ By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . __eou__ Good , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? __eou__ Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent . __eou__
Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? __eou__ Umm ... I think so . What's up ? __eou__ I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . __eou__ Really ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? __eou__ If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . __eou__ Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? __eou__ Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . __eou__ That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? __eou__ Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . __eou__ So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? __eou__ That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . __eou__
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . __eou__ You must have a wonderful time . __eou__ Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__ No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . __eou__ Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? __eou__
Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? __eou__ I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__ Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__ At least you know what American women generally like in a man . __eou__ Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . __eou__ American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . __eou__ You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . __eou__
I heard you are going to move . __eou__ Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . __eou__ What are you worried about ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . __eou__ You can call a mover . __eou__ How much dose that cost ? __eou__ Around 200 RIB for a truck . __eou__ I think it ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__ It ’ s 8357688 8 . __eou__ Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Did you move into your new apartment ? __eou__ Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . __eou__ Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it . __eou__ Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . __eou__ I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure . __eou__ Is there a supermarket nearby ? __eou__ Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . __eou__ Sounds like you better buy a bicycle . __eou__ That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking . __eou__
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . __eou__ But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ That's better . __eou__
What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . __eou__ I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . __eou__ You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . __eou__ That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . __eou__ Two months ? How did you find out ? __eou__ I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . __eou__ So you asked him about the girl who called ? __eou__ Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . __eou__ What'd he do ? __eou__ He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . __eou__
Have heard of Paul ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ He's got a promotion . __eou__ You're kidding . __eou__ No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . __eou__ I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years . __eou__ Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . __eou__ Well.Good for him . __eou__
I'm exhausted . My new exercise is so hard . __eou__ I think it is easy . I could work in your class with no problem . __eou__ You thing so ? __eou__ Oh , without doubt.When is the next class ? __eou__ Tomorrow morning.Try it . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Are you going to this class this morning ? __eou__ Of course , easy.No sweat . __eou__ You're no able to move after this class . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake . __eou__ You want to bet ? __eou__ Yeah , what't the bet ? __eou__ I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . __eou__
How are you , Sue ? __eou__ Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . __eou__ Congratulations on your success . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ And how ’ s your brother ? __eou__ He is fine . __eou__ He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? __eou__ Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . __eou__ Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . __eou__
Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time __eou__ Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? __eou__ Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . __eou__ Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? __eou__
Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? __eou__ No , thanks . __eou__ Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . __eou__ Thank you for your concern . __eou__
I ’ Ve got a new boss . __eou__ Oh , what ’ s he like ? __eou__ Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ And a white sports car . __eou__ Um , that ’ s good . __eou__ Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . __eou__
What are you grinning about ? __eou__ Stephany said she would go out with me . __eou__ I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . __eou__ That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . __eou__ All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? __eou__ We ’ re going fishing . __eou__ What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . __eou__ These girls are different , they are not wimpy . __eou__
How many languages can you speak ? __eou__ I can speak French and German . __eou__ How well can you speak them ? __eou__ I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . __eou__ Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? __eou__ No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work til late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
Hey , Zina . You're here early today . __eou__ Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . __eou__ I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it . __eou__ Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome . __eou__ Fair enough.Keep up the good work . __eou__
Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? __eou__ No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ? __eou__ I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ? __eou__ He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions . __eou__ A little distraction might do you some good , Zina . __eou__
Ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower . __eou__ What's another Japanese art ? __eou__ Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! __eou__ Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony . __eou__ Tea Ceremony ! It's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl __eou__ How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ? __eou__ There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . __eou__
Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? __eou__ Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . __eou__ Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? __eou__ Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! __eou__ I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . __eou__ Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? __eou__ Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . __eou__ Cool ! Teach me ! __eou__ For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . __eou__ Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . __eou__ That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . __eou__
That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing . __eou__ Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? __eou__ You can say that again ! __eou__ What's up with Vince and Elvin ? __eou__ They work for Zina now . __eou__ And they're happy with that ? __eou__ They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . __eou__
Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . __eou__ I'm looking for it , but you see , the market shard for jobs , too . __eou__ You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . __eou__
Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yeah , you have some other ideas ? __eou__ Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . __eou__ Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . __eou__
Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? __eou__ Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit . __eou__ Oh , that's good news for us . __eou__ So what do you provide ? __eou__ First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits . __eou__ How can you get that done ? __eou__ Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs . __eou__ What else ? __eou__ Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ? __eou__ That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . __eou__ Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning . __eou__ Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . __eou__
Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ Yes . Is that so important ? __eou__ Frankly yes . We like to employ married people . By the way , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes , I have a three-year-old son . __eou__
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Germany . __eou__ So you speak German , don't you ? __eou__ Yeah , but I can speak English , too . __eou__ Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? __eou__ A little French . __eou__ Good . __eou__
Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! __eou__ Thanks.Miss Zhang . __eou__ You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . __eou__ Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweet , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . __eou__
Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? __eou__ Yes , is that you , Allen ? __eou__ Yes , how are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? __eou__ Sure.Thank you very much . __eou__ Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? __eou__ Ok , see you . __eou__ See you . __eou__
It's a fine day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . __eou__ How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . __eou__ I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . __eou__ Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . __eou__ You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . __eou__ The weatherman predicts a fine day today . __eou__ The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . __eou__
How old are you ? __eou__ Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? __eou__ I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . __eou__ Are you going to have a birthday party ? __eou__ Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . __eou__
Excuse me . Is there any body here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water . __eou__ Sure , come on in . __eou__ Thank you very much . Are you here alone ? __eou__ My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ? __eou__ I'm a back-packer from America . __eou__ What is a back-packer ? __eou__ It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . __eou__ Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . __eou__ Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . __eou__ So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up . __eou__ You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier . __eou__ I'll try my best . __eou__
Come back . You haven't paid yet . __eou__ May , just let him go . __eou__ But he took some newspaper away without paying . __eou__ I know . __eou__ Why ? You make me confused . __eou__ He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . __eou__ Why does he have such a privilege ? __eou__ He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . __eou__ I see . Does he live by himself ? __eou__ Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . __eou__ He must be lonely ? __eou__ I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . __eou__ How respectable ! __eou__
He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . __eou__ How did he make a fortune ? __eou__ He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . __eou__
Do you think you'll get the project ? __eou__ It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it . __eou__ I see.After all , he's boss's son . __eou__ But anyway , I'll have a try . __eou__
I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . __eou__ Don't you know they've already broken up ? __eou__ I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . __eou__ And he's so handsome . __eou__
I decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . __eou__ I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom . __eou__
Who is that guy ? __eou__ It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! __eou__ Really ? He is my type . __eou__ He is everybody's type . __eou__ What position does he play ? __eou__ Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! __eou__ Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . __eou__ Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . __eou__ Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . __eou__ That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! __eou__ Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__ You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . __eou__ By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? __eou__ You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__ Oh , My chance is slim then . __eou__
Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle . __eou__ Oh , my god , are you OK ? __eou__ Of course not ! __eou__ Come on , sit down , and let me have a look . __eou__ The pain is killing me . __eou__ I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen . __eou__ I thought leather shoes will do just as well . __eou__ Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? __eou__ God ! It's freezing ! __eou__ Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon . __eou__
Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? __eou__ We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . __eou__ Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? __eou__ Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . __eou__ Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? __eou__ Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . __eou__ Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? __eou__ Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . __eou__ You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . __eou__ OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . __eou__ That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? __eou__ Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? __eou__ Exactly , now , tell me the time . __eou__ I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . __eou__
I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . __eou__ He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . __eou__ If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__
Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ? __eou__ Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . __eou__ Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? __eou__ You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . __eou__ Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? __eou__ I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . __eou__ Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . __eou__
Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? __eou__ Is that different from this kind of zoo ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ So tell me about it ! __eou__ There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting . __eou__ Special rules ? __eou__ There , you only have two ways for visiting . __eou__ Details ? __eou__ On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . __eou__ That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I prefer to go there next time . __eou__ Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . __eou__
The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . __eou__ And ? __eou__ And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . __eou__ Poor child ! __eou__
It seldom rains this summer . __eou__ Yeah , some places are very short of water . __eou__ Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . __eou__ You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone . __eou__ It is serious . __eou__
It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . __eou__ Are you sure of that ? __eou__ I am not certain about that . __eou__ They may have some difficulty in doing it . __eou__
You know that ? Dan got a divorce . __eou__ Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . __eou__ Yeah . But his relation with Sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife . __eou__ He deserved it . __eou__
You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . __eou__ Just because he gets on well with everybody ? __eou__ Partly , and he's also a hard working man . __eou__
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? __eou__ No , seriously . . . I really want this . __eou__ I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . __eou__
You want to go with him ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Then you must be off your head . He is a real bastard . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ Yeah . He has no one to count on . __eou__
What did he say ? __eou__ He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . __eou__ It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . __eou__ Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . __eou__
Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? __eou__ No , don't try to tend me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . __eou__ You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . __eou__ I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . __eou__ So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . __eou__
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? __eou__ Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . __eou__ How about Sunday then ? __eou__ Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? __eou__ Does 6 thirty suit you ? __eou__ It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . __eou__ Thanks , goodbye . __eou__
You know John ? __eou__ Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . __eou__ And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . __eou__ I wish he could too . __eou__ How ’ s your boy , Jack ? __eou__ He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . __eou__ Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? __eou__ Good luck to them . __eou__
What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__ How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__ What else do you suggest ? __eou__ Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . __eou__
I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . __eou__ I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . __eou__ The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . __eou__ Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . __eou__ Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . __eou__ Can you ride a horse ? __eou__ Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? __eou__ I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? __eou__ What a good idea ! __eou__
Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . __eou__ Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . __eou__ The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? __eou__ Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . __eou__ When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . __eou__ Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect . __eou__ Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . __eou__
What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? __eou__ Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . __eou__ In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . __eou__ I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? __eou__ If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . __eou__ There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? __eou__ Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . __eou__ The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? __eou__ I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . __eou__ Who ’ s your favourite player ? __eou__ I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . __eou__ Do they have a good team ? __eou__ I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__ I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing . __eou__ I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well . __eou__ You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . __eou__ How many more games are there this season ? __eou__ We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . __eou__
Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . __eou__ There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . __eou__ I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . __eou__ Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . __eou__ When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? __eou__ Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . __eou__ When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things . __eou__ That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__ That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . __eou__ How do I do that ? __eou__ Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again . __eou__ That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . __eou__
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer . __eou__
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__ It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__ Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” . __eou__ Why do they go there ? __eou__ Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . __eou__
What are you reading ? __eou__ It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . __eou__ It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . __eou__ Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . __eou__ Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? __eou__ The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . __eou__ Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . __eou__ Exactly . The article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers . __eou__ In that case , I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages . __eou__
Are you interested in history ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__ I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__ I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! __eou__ Some people say that history repeats itself . __eou__ What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? __eou__ The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . __eou__ I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . __eou__
How do you think people get their personalities ? __eou__ I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . __eou__ Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? __eou__ No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . __eou__ So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . __eou__ Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . __eou__ You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . __eou__ Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? __eou__ Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . __eou__ Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends . __eou__ So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . __eou__
Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ Uh , yes . __eou__ Do you go to work by train every day ? __eou__ Yes . I commute five days a week by train . __eou__ And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? __eou__ It ’ s really very good . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Well , trains are frequent and come on time . __eou__ Which train do you catch in the evening ? __eou__ I usually take the 5 thirty home . __eou__ And can you get a seat ? __eou__ No , I usually have to stand . __eou__ Would you agree that the service is fast ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up25 % . __eou__
London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . __eou__ Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . __eou__ Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s . __eou__ She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? __eou__ There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . __eou__ Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . __eou__ There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . __eou__ Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! __eou__
What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? __eou__ As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . __eou__ There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . __eou__ The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . __eou__ I noticed that too . What are the people learning ? __eou__ In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . __eou__ I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . __eou__ That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? __eou__ Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . __eou__ Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . __eou__ They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . __eou__
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? __eou__ Two . French and Spanish . __eou__ And how well can you speak them ? __eou__ Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__ And how about your Spanish ? __eou__ Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__ I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__ In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? __eou__ I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . __eou__ I believe industry is making us wealthier . __eou__ I don ’ t believe that . __eou__ And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . __eou__ I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . __eou__ That ’ s your opinion not mine . __eou__
Hi , how ’ re you doing ? __eou__ Terrible . __eou__ Oh , what ’ s the matter ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . __eou__ Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . __eou__ Yeah , I guess I should . __eou__ Well , you ’ d better get some rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ? __eou__ Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? __eou__ I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . __eou__ Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money . __eou__ I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . __eou__ You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? __eou__ Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . __eou__ Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . __eou__ Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . __eou__
I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . __eou__ What did you argue about ? __eou__ He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . __eou__ Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . __eou__ Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__ Did you lend him a lot of money ? __eou__ Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . __eou__ Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? __eou__ No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . __eou__ Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? __eou__
what's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . __eou__ My father failed in business . __eou__ Oh , that's really tough . __eou__ Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__ No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__ Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? __eou__ Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? __eou__ It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . __eou__ You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? __eou__ Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ? __eou__ Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady . __eou__ Oh , she is . __eou__ You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . __eou__ Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim . __eou__ Yean . Around five feet five inches tall . __eou__
I just love your hair that way . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Where did you have it done ? __eou__ My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? __eou__ Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . __eou__ Well , it looks very nice . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
I went to the doctor yesterday . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I said I had been to the doctor the day before . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He said I ' d got the flu . __eou__ Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? __eou__ He told me to stay in bed for ten days . __eou__ Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? __eou__ Yes , ten days . __eou__
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__
Um , which of them is the better typist ? __eou__ Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . __eou__ Is there any difference in their short hand ? __eou__ Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . __eou__ How about languages ? __eou__ Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . __eou__ Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . __eou__
Is this your new teacher ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Is she short ? __eou__ No , she ’ s average . __eou__ What color are her eyes ? __eou__ They ’ re dark gray . __eou__ What color is her hair ? __eou__ It ’ s blond . __eou__ And how old is she ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__
How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? __eou__ Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . __eou__ I never eat breakfast though . __eou__ That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . __eou__ I never thought about it that way . __eou__ I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__ Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ I know doctor , thank you so much . __eou__
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . __eou__
Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ? __eou__ You mean Armistice Day . __eou__ Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school . __eou__
How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . __eou__ You're right . We're not really into used stuff . __eou__ Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! __eou__ There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites . __eou__ I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . __eou__ Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! __eou__
Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! __eou__ So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . __eou__ If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! __eou__ Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . __eou__ It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! __eou__
Harry , do you like the opera ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ Why is that ? It is called real art . __eou__ Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . __eou__ Yeah , that makes sense . __eou__
Hey , guys ! __eou__ Hi ! Nicole ! __eou__ How's business ? __eou__ Great . We can't keep up with the demand . __eou__ Wow ! I'm impressed ! __eou__ How about you ? __eou__ I quit my job as a food critic . __eou__ Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate . __eou__
I'd love that . I'm so glad I quit . It's time for a change . __eou__ Does that mean you're going to take my advice ? __eou__ Yes . I'm looking for a position as a chef . __eou__ I might be able to help ... __eou__ I'm sure you have great connections . __eou__ We'd like to open another restaurant ... with you as the head chef and manager ... __eou__ Really ? You have that much faith in me ? And Giovanni agreed to it ? Does he know who I am ? __eou__ Yes . But you know him . He's just worried that you're not Italian ... __eou__ He's prejudiced , isn't he ? __eou__ No . He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did . __eou__ Ah ! I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food ! __eou__ How's that ? __eou__ You'll see next week . I'll come by one day at lunchtime . __eou__
I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? __eou__ He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . __eou__ Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . __eou__ When did you start worrying about your weight ? __eou__ I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? __eou__ No , Jess , chill out ! __eou__
Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny ! __eou__ Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success . __eou__ It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me . __eou__ Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them . __eou__ Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once ! __eou__ Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way . __eou__
These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? __eou__ Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . __eou__ That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . __eou__ Teresa Jones got a boob job . __eou__ Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . __eou__ I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ... __eou__
Are you sure it was him ? __eou__ I used to date him . Of course it was him . __eou__ You're a nurse at New York General Hospital ? __eou__ Yes , on the cancer ward . And Taylor was there . He walked right by me and didn't even see me . __eou__ Maybe he was just visiting someone . __eou__ But you saw how skinny and pale he looks . He has " cancer patient " written all over his face . __eou__
Does anyone need a drink ? __eou__ I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ? __eou__ It's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . Here you are-cheers ! __eou__ Cheers . You guys didn't drive , did you ? __eou__ No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? __eou__ No , it's just that it's a holiday . With everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy . __eou__ I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies . __eou__ Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ? __eou__ They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it . __eou__
He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? __eou__ I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . __eou__ As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case . __eou__ True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? __eou__ Yeah ! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth ? __eou__
What have you been up to , Johnny ? __eou__ You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... __eou__ Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? __eou__ You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . __eou__ You have all the fun , don't you ? __eou__ Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . __eou__ Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid ! __eou__
You want to go to the movies tonight ? __eou__ Sure ! What ' s playing ? __eou__ The new Twilight movie ! __eou__ Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . __eou__ Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . __eou__ I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! __eou__
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! __eou__
Trina , will you marry me ? __eou__ Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! __eou__ Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . __eou__ Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! __eou__ She what ? __eou__ Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . __eou__ Four hundred ? __eou__ No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? __eou__ Ah ... __eou__ And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! __eou__ Wow . __eou__ See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . __eou__ If I survive the next six months . __eou__
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ Have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ Well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ Geez . Is that all ? __eou__ Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! __eou__
Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious . __eou__ Yeah , I'm OK , I have been having a lot of mood swings lately . I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones . __eou__ So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? __eou__ Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . __eou__ Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! __eou__ I hope you are right . __eou__
What are you doing , awake ? __eou__ I can't sleep ... __eou__ But it's almost midnight ! __eou__ Exactly . I'm too excited for Christmas morning . Also , I thought I heard Santa . __eou__ Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? __eou__ Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! __eou__ Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! __eou__ O-K ... __eou__ Hey , honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some , too ! __eou__
Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ? __eou__ Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? __eou__ Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . __eou__ Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . __eou__ Yes , me too . __eou__ I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising . __eou__
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . __eou__
Honey , do you have a second ? __eou__ Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? __eou__ We need to talk . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . __eou__ What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! __eou__ So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? __eou__ Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . __eou__ Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . __eou__ I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . __eou__ Laura ... __eou__ Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . __eou__
Where to , miss ? __eou__ Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . __eou__ Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? __eou__ From China . __eou__ Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__ It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__ Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! __eou__ Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__ I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__ Uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__ Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! __eou__
I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! __eou__ Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! __eou__ Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? __eou__ He ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... __eou__ He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? __eou__ You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! __eou__ Hold on a sec , his name is David ? __eou__ Yeah ? __eou__ That ’ s my brother ! __eou__
I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__ Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__ Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__ Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__ That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute ! __eou__ I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__ That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous . Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? __eou__ Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? __eou__
I heard that ben is forming his own band . __eou__ It will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . __eou__ Can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . __eou__ I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . __eou__ I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . __eou__ Nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don't need to be able to play music instrument or thing . __eou__ I love to try it , but the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice . __eou__ You know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . __eou__
What kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . __eou__ You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ May I know your name , please ? __eou__ I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? __eou__ Ah , yes . I remember now . Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ? __eou__ Yes , I was . You work for 3M , right ? __eou__ I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft . How are things with you ? __eou__ Good . __eou__ May I know what you do ? __eou__ I ’ m a fashion designer . Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets . So you can bring a friend if you like . __eou__ Sure . That would be great . Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
What ’ s the area of your country ? __eou__ It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . __eou__ That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__ What ’ s the average income ? __eou__ That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ So your country is fairly rich . __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . __eou__
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . __eou__
What book is that ? __eou__ I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . __eou__ Canada , China , and the USA are huge too . __eou__ There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . __eou__ Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . __eou__ Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . __eou__ The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . __eou__
Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? __eou__ There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . __eou__ Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . __eou__ Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . __eou__ What is the international community doing to help ? __eou__ The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . __eou__ How many countries have been affected ? __eou__ Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . __eou__ I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran . __eou__ Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . __eou__ Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? __eou__ So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . __eou__
How are the children doing at sport ? __eou__ I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__ He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__ He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age . __eou__ Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__ The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__ How are they at swimming ? __eou__ They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__ It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . __eou__
Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? __eou__ You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . __eou__ Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? __eou__ Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . __eou__
Now , David , can I get you a drink ? What will you have ? __eou__ Coffee , please . __eou__ What about you , Mary ? __eou__ Coke is fine.Thank you . __eou__

I want to have a complete relaxation this weekend . __eou__ You mean you want to stay at home ? __eou__ Yes , exactly . __eou__ I thought maybe you were interested in an outing . __eou__
Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ? __eou__ Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him . __eou__ I see.Did they succeed in the end ? __eou__ Of course not.He drowned . __eou__
Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . __eou__ No problem . What should I bring ? __eou__ I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . __eou__
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? __eou__ I attend an aerobic class three times a week . __eou__ Aren't you tired ? __eou__ No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . __eou__
Hi , Francis . __eou__ Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . __eou__ Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . __eou__ Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . __eou__ Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . __eou__ Me too . Have a great day . __eou__
Will it be all right to visit you this evening ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I have an appointment this evening.How about tomorrow evening ? __eou__ It's fine with me . __eou__
Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . __eou__ Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . __eou__ No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . __eou__ Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . __eou__ Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? __eou__ Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . __eou__ Make yourself at home . __eou__ It is such a nice place . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . __eou__
Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? __eou__ Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it . __eou__ Better luck this time ! __eou__
Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat . __eou__ Please come in , Mr.Jackson . __eou__ No , thank you.Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . __eou__

Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . __eou__ That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . __eou__ Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . __eou__
It's hard to get tickets for the movie . __eou__ Did you get any ? __eou__ Yeah , two at the tenth rows . __eou__ How much is the ticket ? __eou__ 3.5 dollars each . __eou__
When it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ Past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ? __eou__ Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__ But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__ If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . __eou__ I will think about it . __eou__
I think this one will do . __eou__ I'm sorry . I don't think so . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong with it ? __eou__ It's much too hard for his age . __eou__
We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ? __eou__ As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies . __eou__ Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work . __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ And how's everyone in your family ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.Would you care to join us ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I'm afraid I can't . __eou__
I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . __eou__ Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club . __eou__ You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . __eou__ I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . __eou__
Japanese is easy to learn . __eou__ You're mistaken about it . As a matter of fact , it's very hard . __eou__ I don't think so.There ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese . __eou__ You're quite right.But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes . __eou__
I wonder if you agree that money is not happiness . __eou__ I don't entirely agree with you . __eou__ Then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ? __eou__ Well , that's a thing . __eou__
Hey ! What's up ? __eou__ Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . __eou__ Yeah , I've been out of town . __eou__ So how have you been ? __eou__ Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . __eou__
Did you hear peter just retired ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__ He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__ Really ? He looks so young . __eou__
Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? __eou__ For What ? __eou__ Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . __eou__ Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . __eou__
Here , Let me get the door for you . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Do you need a hand with that ? __eou__ Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__
How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing ? __eou__ Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before ! __eou__ Do you know why that is ? __eou__ Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days . __eou__
I love ice cream . __eou__ Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__ I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . __eou__ Chocolate is mine . __eou__
Well , what brings you here ? __eou__ I came to see my aunt . __eou__ Does she live nearby ? __eou__ Yes . She lives on the next block . __eou__

I went hiking in the mountains on Saturday . __eou__ Fantastic ! how was that ? __eou__ Really good ! you should try it sometime . __eou__ I might . what did you do yesterday ? __eou__ Uh , nothing much , just went to bed early . I was still tired from Saturday . __eou__
Show us our itineraries , please . __eou__ We'll first go to Mount Tai , then we'll go to Sichuan by air , after that we'll be leaving for Tibet . __eou__ How long will the trip take ? __eou__ At least 20 days . __eou__
Do you like watching TV ? __eou__ Yes I do , usually . __eou__ What do you exactly mean by usually ? __eou__ I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV . __eou__
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? __eou__ Yeah , about . __eou__ Do you know Chinese better now ? __eou__ Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . __eou__ I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . __eou__ I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . __eou__ Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ Yes , absolutely true . __eou__
Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . __eou__
Can I get you something to drink ? __eou__ No , that's okay , I already have a coke.Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day . __eou__ I guess I could take a break.So , how do you like Denver ? __eou__ It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? __eou__ About six years ... __eou__ What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I manage one of the ski lodges.It ' s a great job , I can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and I also get to ski for free all season . __eou__ Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that.But I am only an accountant.Not too much excitement there.huh ? __eou__ That's okay.If it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing ! __eou__
The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? __eou__ No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? __eou__ It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . __eou__ I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . __eou__ Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ? __eou__ Now you're talking . __eou__
Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . __eou__
Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today . __eou__ Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune . __eou__ Well , you can just comfort yourself like that . __eou__
Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__ John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . __eou__ I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__ Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__ Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . __eou__ I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . __eou__ I think you ’ re right ! __eou__
Come in , come in ! __eou__ Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet here . __eou__ Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . __eou__
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . __eou__
So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand . __eou__ You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? __eou__ Actually it will be my first time to meet her . __eou__ You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her . __eou__ That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month . __eou__ Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . __eou__ The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . __eou__ Probably you ’ re right . __eou__
So do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ Palmistry ? What is that ? __eou__ It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . __eou__ Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . __eou__ Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__ Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? __eou__ Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? __eou__ You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . __eou__ Hey ! __eou__
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . __eou__ But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ That's better . __eou__
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . __eou__
Do you hear what happened to Sally ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ She had to go to the hospital . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . __eou__ Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! __eou__ Yeah , but that's what she did . __eou__ I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . __eou__ Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . __eou__ True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . __eou__
Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . __eou__ Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . __eou__ Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . __eou__ So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? __eou__ Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . __eou__ Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . __eou__ That ’ s a great employment benefit ! __eou__ Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! __eou__
What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . __eou__ You're becoming a real television watcher . __eou__ A lot of people feel the same way . __eou__
I wonder if we can change to Channel 26 . __eou__ Why ? I'd like to see what's on that channel . __eou__ A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like . __eou__ I prefer boxing to beef . __eou__
So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? __eou__ Stolen ? No , why ? __eou__ My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . __eou__ Criminals are clever ? They ’ re only successful when people are careless . __eou__ I don ’ t know . The ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good . __eou__ If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened . __eou__ He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . And on a crowded street too . __eou__ Didn ’ t anyone stop them ? __eou__ You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . __eou__ Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren ’ t that dumb after all . __eou__ That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . __eou__
What's your favorite kind of music ? Do you like pop music ? __eou__ I like almost all kinds of music . But I like country music best . __eou__ There was a concert country music last week . __eou__ I wish I had been there ! __eou__ I like it , too . But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music . __eou__ You have good taste in music . __eou__
It will do you good to go out for entertainment at weekends.What kind of movie do you like best ? __eou__ It's hard to say , I like interesting and significant ones . I don't care whether they're blockbusters or not . __eou__ Shall we go downtown for a movie this Friday evening ? __eou__ Very good , What's on ? __eou__ I'm not sure . Let me give a call to find out . __eou__
What are the most popular sports in your country ? __eou__ Swimming in summer and skating in winter.What ' s your favorite sport ? __eou__ Jogging and bowling .

I can teach you how to bowl . __eou__ Right . Let's help each other . __eou__
Have you ever been to any other country ? __eou__ Pity I haven't . If I can afford it , I'll certainly take a trip abroad . __eou__ That's also my dream . __eou__ How about going to italy next summer vacation ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
I've booked an air ticket to Venice . __eou__ How long will you be there ? __eou__ I'd like to stay there for a week . __eou__ So you'll have a tour of the famous city . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
What shall I call him ? __eou__ Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . __eou__ What's he doing ? __eou__ He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . __eou__
What did you do last vacation ? __eou__ I learned to drive and I got a driving license . __eou__ What will you do this vacation ? __eou__ Travel . __eou__
Is this a photo of your family ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . __eou__ You look so lovely . __eou__ How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . __eou__
What lovely weather ! __eou__ It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . __eou__ Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air . __eou__ All right.Let ' s go . __eou__
Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman . __eou__ How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ? __eou__ No , I'm not asking for money . I'm asking for your advice . __eou__ Oh , you've already grown up , son . __eou__
Whose part do you think is best played ? __eou__ That of the old man . __eou__ You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . __eou__ Some of the scenes moved me into tears . __eou__
The acting of this film is marvelous.In spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the Academy Award of this year . __eou__ I'm sorry for hero . I dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . __eou__ Don't be too critical.We can't expect it to be perfect . __eou__
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... __eou__
Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO . __eou__ I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again . __eou__ Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it . __eou__
I've got an idea . Let's make this game even more interesting . __eou__ How ? Do you want to play strip-trivia or something ? __eou__ Well , if you want to ! Seriously , though , let's make a bet . __eou__ Why don't we just make it a friendly game ? __eou__ Don't be such a chicken ! Whoever loses has to treat everyone to a movie . __eou__
I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . __eou__ I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! __eou__ You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . __eou__ In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . __eou__ Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! __eou__
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . __eou__ Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . __eou__
hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? __eou__ I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? __eou__ I'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . __eou__ have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? __eou__ no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__ not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? __eou__ yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__ do you have experience in the IT field ? __eou__ I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . __eou__ do you speak Spanish ? __eou__ yes , but not fluently . __eou__ that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? __eou__ I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__ did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__ no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . __eou__ I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . __eou__ thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! __eou__
Hi , Alex . How are you doing ? __eou__ Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! __eou__ I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner . __eou__ I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? __eou__
Well , the way you drive , Jen ... I still don't think that's a good idea . __eou__ I really love this music . It's a compilation . __eou__ I know . It's a mix of all the latest songs . __eou__ And you got them off the Net ? __eou__ No . I recorded these from your Cds . __eou__ Well , thanks for asking for my permission ... Now hand it over and let me record ! __eou__ I knew I shouldn't have shown you my new toy ... __eou__
I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... __eou__ Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ? __eou__ Not yet ... I got an MP3 player and a set of stereo headphones . __eou__ So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ? __eou__ Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free ! __eou__ Let me see it ! It's so small ! __eou__
Too ... your face is really oily ... perfect ! __eou__ Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ? __eou__ Nope . I'm going to tell your fortune . So ... the oilier , the better . __eou__ You've gone bonkers , Jen . __eou__ It's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! It's magical . __eou__ OK . Let's see . Give me a sheet . __eou__
What are you hiding in your coat pocket ? __eou__ It's a camera . __eou__ You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ? __eou__ Not even funny , Billy . This is my new snapshot sticker camera . __eou__ What's that supposed to mean ? __eou__ Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere . __eou__
What's the matter with you , Paul ? __eou__ I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . __eou__ Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . __eou__ Yeah , I will . __eou__
I heard you've found a new job . __eou__ Yes , I'm now working in a company . __eou__ So you're quite happy with your new job ? __eou__ Right . I enjoy what I'm doing . __eou__
Are you ready for the camping trip ? __eou__ All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ... __eou__ Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature . __eou__ Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ? __eou__ I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack . __eou__ Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ? __eou__ That's trail mix ! __eou__ Same difference . What's this ? __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__ Yes , please do . __eou__ Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__ Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__ Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . __eou__ Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . __eou__ No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . __eou__ Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . __eou__ Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? __eou__ Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . __eou__ Make yourself at home . __eou__ It is such a nice place . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . __eou__
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . __eou__ That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__ It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__ That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Did you sign up for the picnic party ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . __eou__ This time you can bring your daughter with you . __eou__ Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . __eou__ There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . __eou__
Let ’ s call it a day . __eou__ It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__ It ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__ Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . __eou__
How do I look in this new dress ? __eou__ You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly . __eou__ How about this one ? __eou__ It ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well . __eou__
You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? __eou__ He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? __eou__ I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . __eou__ I can think of better things to dream about ... __eou__ Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . __eou__ That's crazy . __eou__
Have you ever played Making ? __eou__ Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . __eou__ Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . __eou__ Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . __eou__
Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . __eou__ Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . __eou__ I will think about it . __eou__ Come on ! It is really a fun game . __eou__
I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . __eou__ Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? __eou__ Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... __eou__ So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? __eou__ No . I borrowed it to go shopping . __eou__
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? __eou__ Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . __eou__ It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . __eou__ You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . __eou__ Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! __eou__ It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . __eou__
Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? __eou__ Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . __eou__ Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . __eou__ Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . __eou__
I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . __eou__ Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . __eou__ Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . __eou__ Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . __eou__ With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . __eou__ Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . __eou__ Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . __eou__
Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? __eou__ Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . __eou__ Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? __eou__ Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . __eou__ I didn ’ t pay attention to that . __eou__
Hi , Francis . __eou__ Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . __eou__ Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . __eou__ Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . __eou__ Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . __eou__ Me too . Have a great day . __eou__
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . __eou__
I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . __eou__ That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . __eou__ Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . __eou__ The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... __eou__ I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! __eou__
It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . __eou__ The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . __eou__ Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . __eou__ It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . __eou__
Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! __eou__ Yeah . How's everything going ? __eou__ Not bad . At least I am still alive . __eou__ Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . __eou__ You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . __eou__ Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . __eou__
How about having a cup of tea with us ? __eou__ All right.That ’ s very nice of you . __eou__ Would you like to go to the cinema with me ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow . __eou__
Oh my god ! It's 10:00 pm . I have to go . __eou__ Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I am afraid not . __eou__ Say hi to your parents for me . I hope to see them soon . __eou__ Thank you . Well , if you ever pass my home , please drop in . __eou__ Yes , I will . Take care , then . __eou__ Yes , sure . Have a sweet dream ! __eou__
May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith . __eou__ Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . __eou__
Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . __eou__ In that case , I won ’ t keep you any longer . Drop in anytime . __eou__ Ok , Goodbye . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
The whether in Beijing is just beautiful . __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know ? __eou__ Yes . I can see . The summer heat is over . And the winter cold is still far away . __eou__ What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ? __eou__ Autumn is also very nice In Washington . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter there ? __eou__ No . it isn ’ t . But sometimes it slows a lot in winter . __eou__ Does it rain a lot in summer there ? __eou__ Oh . Yes . Sometimes it rains very heavily __eou__ How about here in Beijing ? __eou__ There ’ s a lot of rain in summer . But it seldom rains in autumn __eou__ I feel it ’ s rather dry here __eou__ That ’ s true . many people from the south don ’ t like the whether here . __eou__ Are you from south ? __eou__ No . I ’ m from the north . I was born in Beijing actually . __eou__ I see . So this is your hometown ? __eou__
How about going swimming ? __eou__ Ok . Where should we go ? __eou__ Why don ’ t we down to the pool ? It ’ s not too far from here . __eou__ Fine . I ’ ll be ready in a minute . __eou__
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Who won ? __eou__ China . __eou__ What is the score ? __eou__ China beat Brazil three to zero . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__

Did you hear peter just retired ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__ He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__ Really ? He looks so young . __eou__
Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ? __eou__ Yes , I am.You must be Tom.Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you too.Let me help you with your bags . __eou__ Be careful , Tom.Those are pretty heavy . __eou__ Wow , you're not kidding.Hold on a second.Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? __eou__
I think Andy's party will be fun . __eou__ Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? __eou__ Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? __eou__ My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . __eou__
Hello , Elitherbeth How are you ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . __eou__ Are you sure you ’ re alright . You look a bit worry today ? Is anything wrong ? __eou__ Well , Yes . There are something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice . __eou__ of course if I can . __eou__ Well , Last night when I returned from thetheatre I found I lost my wallet . __eou__ Oh dear . That ’ s terrible . What was in your wallet ? __eou__ Well , some money of course , a vise , all my identity cards and some photos . __eou__ Well , If I were you , I would go to the police station straight away and calling . __eou__ Yes , I have already done that and they already look for it . I ’ ll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly . __eou__ Oh dear . What a pity . Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre ? __eou__ Yes , quite sure . __eou__ I think you should put an advertisement in china daily . Things where you lasted . __eou__ But that takes too long . __eou__ Wait a minute , My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre . I ’ Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later . __eou__
Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? __eou__ You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . __eou__ Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? __eou__ Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . __eou__
So Janet , do you do any sports ? __eou__ Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . __eou__ Yeah , how often do you go ? __eou__ About three times a week if I can . __eou__ Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? __eou__ Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . __eou__
Let's take a coffee break , shall we ? __eou__ I wish I could , but I can't . __eou__ What keeps you so busy ? You've been sitting there for hours . You've got to walk around.You just can't stay on the computer forever . __eou__ Well , I am up to my neck in work . I've got to finish this report . Sarah needs it by noon . I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline . __eou__ I understand that , but you'd feel better if you took a break , even for just a short while . __eou__
Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . __eou__ It's certainly a tight schedule . __eou__ Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . __eou__ At what time ? __eou__ My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . __eou__ Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? __eou__ No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . __eou__ Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . __eou__ You are a pessimist . __eou__ I am a realist . __eou__
Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . __eou__ Sure , When is good time for you ? __eou__ Can you make it on Tuesday ? __eou__ What time do you want me there ? __eou__ Anytime after six will be fine . __eou__ All right , It's a date . __eou__

Hello ! __eou__ Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again . __eou__ Hi , Jason ! Long time no see . How's the hotel ? __eou__ It's pretty nice , but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon . Hotel living is not for me . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ How about you ? When are you leaving for Berkeley ? __eou__ I am leaving in two weeks . __eou__ So soon ! Well , I'd really like to see you again before you leave . Would you like to go out with me on Friday ? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards . __eou__ Oh , I am sorry , Jason . I've already got plans for Friday evening . How about Saturday ? __eou__ Saturday is fine . I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o ’ clock . Is that ok ? __eou__ 7 is fine with me . __eou__ Great . I'll pick you up at six thirty . __eou__ I'll be waiting . __eou__
Hi , Mike . Haven't seen you for a while . How's Cathy ? __eou__ We are not seeing each other any more . __eou__ What happened ? Did you break up ? __eou__ Yeah . I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time . __eou__ Oh , I am sorry . Maybe you were just emotional at that moment . Do you think you guys can get back together ? __eou__ I don't know . There ’ s plenty of fish out there in the sea ! __eou__ Oh , you are such a dog ! __eou__
What newspaper are you reading ? __eou__ New York Times . I read it everyday . __eou__ Why don't you read the local newspaper ? __eou__ It's too biased . I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting . __eou__ New York Times is better ? __eou__ Yes , they have a good reputation for fairness . __eou__
What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? __eou__ I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . __eou__ What do you like best about it ? __eou__ I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . __eou__ What do you think of the ending ? __eou__ The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . __eou__
As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . __eou__ It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . __eou__ Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . __eou__ For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . __eou__ That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . __eou__ Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . __eou__
The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . __eou__ On this occasion , most people do . __eou__ Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . __eou__ She is a beautiful bride . __eou__ I am so happy for them . __eou__ Are you crying ? __eou__ Yes , I always cry at weddings . __eou__ Harris and Anne are perfect for each other . __eou__ Yes , they are . __eou__ You and Tom also make a great couple . __eou__ In fact , we are beginning to make preparations . __eou__ For the wedding ? __eou__ No , no , for the engagement . __eou__ Try to catch this bouquet then . __eou__
I hear Jean married a business tycoon . __eou__ That's true . Her husband is a fat cat . __eou__ But I don't think she really loves him . __eou__ She is only after his money . __eou__ If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love . __eou__ But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough . __eou__
I heard you are going out with John ? __eou__ Yes . To be frank , I really love him to death . __eou__ You are so lucky . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Why ? Are you kidding me ? A guy like that is hard to find . Few boys are so caring , so patient , and did I mention he is hottie ? __eou__ You really think so ? __eou__ Totally . I am saying it from the bottom of my heart ! And it's obvious that he ’ s head over heels in love with you , too . __eou__ I sure hope so . __eou__
You have a lovely house , Jack . __eou__ Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . __eou__ That's too bad . What problems are you having . __eou__ Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . __eou__ I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? __eou__ Go right ahead . __eou__ Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room __eou__ Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . __eou__
You look run down , Brian . __eou__ I've been feeling under the weather recently . I caught a bad cold last week , and I still haven't got over it . __eou__ Well , you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good , long rest . __eou__ I guess so . Even though I seem to be over the worst of it . I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
What did the doctor say ? __eou__ He said that I have been eating too much . __eou__ Did he give you any advice ? __eou__ Yes , he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat . __eou__ Yes , you must put yourself on a diet . __eou__
It's a perfect day for swimming . __eou__ I am going to the beech . How about coming with me ? __eou__ Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill ’ s party .. __eou__ Don't forget the sun block lotion . You don't want a sunburn , do you ? __eou__ No . Thanks for reminding me . __eou__
So how did you meet Bill ? __eou__ I met him through a computer bulletin board . __eou__ Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? __eou__ It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . __eou__ I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . __eou__ You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . __eou__ I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . __eou__ That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . __eou__ I just want a private conversation with one other person . __eou__ You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . __eou__ Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . __eou__ That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . __eou__ It ’ s that popular ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__
Did you hear how cold it got last night ? __eou__ I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . __eou__ It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . __eou__ My car didn't want to start either at first . __eou__ Don't you have a garage ? __eou__ Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . __eou__ How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . __eou__ I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . __eou__ Does it ever get that cold on here ? __eou__ Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . __eou__ Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . __eou__
Look how fast that car can accelerate ! __eou__ I've never seen anything like it . __eou__
Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Yeah , those classics from the great writers . __eou__ But I find Japanese ones better . __eou__
Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? __eou__ Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . __eou__ Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? __eou__ Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . __eou__ It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . __eou__ Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . __eou__ It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? __eou__ Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . __eou__
Hello , james . Come in . go through to the living room . __eou__ Hi Kate ... thanks ... wow ! Look at all the furniture . You must spent a fortune on it ! I love your new three-pieces suite . __eou__ I told you that I had been saving up money to buy some new furniture and do some redecorating . I finally saved enough and did everything at once . __eou__ Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day ! __eou__ Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . __eou__ To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ? __eou__ Well spotted ! I actually had it cleaned twice , because it was so dirty . The rug is new . You remember my trip to china ? Well , I bought is there . __eou__
We're going out to dinner and then to the movies . __eou__ Hold on ! I can't afford to pay for both . __eou__ Don't worry . I've got money . It's my treat . __eou__ Gee , that's really nice of you . __eou__
Hey , Susie , what health club do you belong to ? __eou__ Total Fitness , why ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve been going to Athletic Express , but I don ’ t like it there . __eou__ Really ? Why not ? I hear it ’ s pretty good . __eou__ The people don ’ t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s one of those places . __eou__ Yeah , is your club different ? __eou__ Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ’ t so many people . __eou__ Do they have a lot of equipment ? __eou__ Yeah , they have all the machines , a pool , and a steam room and sauna . __eou__ Sounds nice . What about classes ? __eou__ The usual . Aerobics , kickboxing , yoga . They just started a Tai Chi class too . __eou__ Wow , that sounds great . __eou__ Well , I have a guest pass . Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ? __eou__ Really ? Thanks . I ’ ll stop by when I get off work . __eou__ Perfect . See you later . __eou__ O . K . , see you . __eou__
How are your parents these days ? __eou__ Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement . __eou__ Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Please give my best regards to them when you're home . __eou__ Sure , thank you . __eou__
I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . __eou__ Yes . It's perfect . __eou__ And all of the flowers are in bloom . __eou__ I couldn't have asked for more . __eou__
Has your family lived here for long ? __eou__ Five and a half years . We moved here on the first of November . __eou__ You have a fantastic view . __eou__ Yes . I love living here . __eou__ Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley . __eou__ Yes . It ’ s a lovely view . __eou__
At last ! The weekend comes again ! __eou__ Yes . What will you do these two days ? __eou__ After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun . __eou__ But I'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest . __eou__
Hey , I'm hungry . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah , I can really go for some Chinese food right now . __eou__ That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant . __eou__ I know one . Let's go . __eou__
Mary , do you remember when we met ? __eou__ I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ... __eou__ And I came up and asked to sit by you ... __eou__ Oh , it seems like it was just yesterday . __eou__
Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S . __eou__ Yes . I'm leaving tomorrow . I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you . __eou__ You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . __eou__ I'll miss you too , my friends . __eou__
Do you like to dance ? __eou__ Sometimes , if there's music playing . __eou__ What kind of dancing do you like ? __eou__ It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet . __eou__
Have you seen any good movies lately ? __eou__ It's ages since I went to see a film . __eou__ Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student . __eou__ But now I would stay at home watching TV . __eou__
What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? __eou__ I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . __eou__ When is your garden at its best ? __eou__ It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . __eou__
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . __eou__ I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__ Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__ I will . See you later . __eou__
Our team just scored a goal . __eou__ That's more like it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ They might actually win the game . __eou__
Do you like ice skating ? __eou__ I have never tried it . __eou__ Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . __eou__ Sorry , I don't think I can . __eou__ Friday then . How about it ? __eou__ Friday is great . __eou__ It's settled then . __eou__
Hey , David . Where did you get the sofa ? It's so beautiful . Look at the color , I really love this yellow , so bright ! It must be very expensive . __eou__ Not really . To be honest , it's very cheap . I only spent $ 100 . __eou__ Are you kidding ? $ 100 for this big leather sofa ? __eou__ Yes . I bought it in Johnson thrift store . __eou__ Is it a used one ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive . __eou__
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__ Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? __eou__ Just as usual , you know . __eou__
Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ It ’ s as plain as the nose on your face . They ’ re dating each other . __eou__ You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . __eou__
So what kind of music turns you on ? __eou__ Rock'n'Roll , I guess . __eou__ You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? __eou__ Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . __eou__
Who is this on the water buffalo ? __eou__ That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . __eou__ Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . __eou__ My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . __eou__ That's interesting . Go on ! __eou__ My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . __eou__ So he became a self-taught man ? __eou__ Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . __eou__ In what field ? __eou__ As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country . __eou__ Is he still in that that type of work . __eou__ No . He retired from that . He is a senator now . __eou__ Would you want to be a senator ? __eou__ Well , maybe when I get old . But first I'll be a lawyer . __eou__
Sheila , what time should we meet tomorrow ? __eou__ The usual time . Half past two in the afternoon . __eou__ What place ? __eou__ The usual place . In front of the treasure house . __eou__ And what should I wear ? __eou__ Your usual shirt and shoes . __eou__ What are you going to wear ? __eou__ Nothing unusual , I ’ m afraid . __eou__ Sheila , how about that fashionable blue dress ? __eou__ Good . That ’ s something unusual . __eou__
Mom ? __eou__ Mm ? __eou__ Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ? __eou__ Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ? __eou__ Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Are these your triplets ? They ’ re beautiful ! I ’ Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age . You know , they ’ re absolutely identical of you and John ! Are you planning on having any more ? __eou__ Bite your tongue ! I ’ m already at the end of my rope . Some nights I don ’ t sleep at all . John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs . __eou__ Well , tell me . How was the labor and delivery ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch . __eou__ Well , hang in there . In twenty years , you ’ ll fell it was well worth it ! __eou__
Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving . __eou__ We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . __eou__ Out ? What do you mean out ? __eou__ You know on a date , they are going to dinner . __eou__ Dad and mom ? __eou__ Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition . __eou__ You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? __eou__ That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? __eou__
What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ? __eou__ Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter __eou__ Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ? __eou__ Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us . __eou__ Easy . It ’ s on me . __eou__ In that case , I ’ m right behind you . __eou__
How do you do ? I ’ m Parker . __eou__ How do you do ? Mr . Barker . __eou__ Parker . __eou__ Oh , Parker with a P ? __eou__ Yes , with a P . __eou__ Er ... I ’ m Barker . __eou__ Barker ? With a B . Of course . __eou__ Yes , with a B . __eou__ Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ? __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Parker . __eou__
I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . __eou__ I'll try to speak more clearly . __eou__
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . __eou__ I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . __eou__
Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . __eou__ It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . __eou__ Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! __eou__ Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! __eou__ A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! __eou__ The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! __eou__ Great play ! __eou__ We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! __eou__ Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! __eou__
Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . __eou__ Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . __eou__ Now that ’ s a great idea ! __eou__
It's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? __eou__ It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . __eou__ What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . __eou__ That doesn't sound pretty . __eou__ Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ Well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . __eou__ You might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . __eou__ I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ If you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! __eou__ If that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__ Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! __eou__ English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . __eou__
What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? __eou__ It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th __eou__ Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . __eou__ I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no __eou__ Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? __eou__ Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . __eou__ Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? __eou__ I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . __eou__ Thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__ My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__ Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . __eou__
Good morning . I ’ m from the new york book review . Could I ask you some question about your latest book ? __eou__ Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? __eou__ First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . __eou__ That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . __eou__ How do you research your books ? __eou__ I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most charact __eou__ I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! __eou__ Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . __eou__ Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? __eou__ There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your __eou__ Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . __eou__
I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ? __eou__ Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . __eou__ I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . __eou__ It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . __eou__
How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? __eou__ I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! __eou__ I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . __eou__ I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense . __eou__ Do you have a brand preference for anything ? __eou__ I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . __eou__ What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? __eou__ It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it . __eou__ I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! __eou__ To each their own ! __eou__
Let ’ s play a game ! __eou__ OK ! How about Scrabble ? __eou__ No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! __eou__ OK ! __eou__ Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! __eou__ Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ Your future husband ! __eou__ Not funny . __eou__
Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . __eou__ Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . __eou__ Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . __eou__
Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . __eou__ So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ It ’ s about time ! __eou__
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! __eou__
Hi . What's up ? __eou__ Nothing much . What's new with you ? __eou__ Not too much . I've been pretty busy . __eou__ Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . __eou__ Gotta go . Call me tonight . __eou__ Okay . Check you later . __eou__
Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? __eou__ Yeah how ’ d you know ? __eou__ You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? __eou__ Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . __eou__ It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? __eou__ Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . __eou__ In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . __eou__ Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! __eou__ It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... __eou__
Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? __eou__ Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? __eou__ Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . __eou__ If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! __eou__ My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! __eou__ Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? __eou__ If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! __eou__
Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . __eou__ Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? __eou__ Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __eou__ I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . __eou__ Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__ Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . __eou__ How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . __eou__ You have always been so soft , Dave ! __eou__ Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . __eou__ Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? __eou__ Of course . Are you a new member here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Welcome . My name is Johnson . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Do you have any experience using weights ? __eou__ No , I don't . So I need some help . __eou__ Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . __eou__ Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . __eou__ Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . __eou__ What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . __eou__ No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . __eou__ I'm ready . __eou__ Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . __eou__ I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . __eou__ Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . __eou__ Alright . Great . __eou__ So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . __eou__ Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? __eou__ Are you alright ? Can you do more ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . __eou__ That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . __eou__ What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . __eou__ We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? __eou__ Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . __eou__
Excuse me . Is anyone in that seat next to you ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . __eou__ Do you mind if I put my jacket there ? __eou__ No . It's no problem.Are you American ? __eou__ Yes . And you ? __eou__ No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ? __eou__ Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American . __eou__ I don't think so . You are flattering me . __eou__ No , really . I can only hear a little accent . __eou__ Are you flying home ? __eou__ Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit . __eou__ You were visiting Taiwan ? __eou__ No , I'm going back to America to visit . I'm from America , but I don't live there now . I live in Taichung . __eou__ Really ! You live in Taiwan ! __eou__ Yes . Why not ? __eou__ May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ? __eou__ Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ? __eou__ Of course . It's a good school . How long have you lived in Taichung ? __eou__ I have lived in Taichung for two years now.So this is the second time I am going back to states . I go back once a year to visit my family . __eou__ It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan . __eou__ No , it isn't strange at all.Many people from Taiwan move to America too , you know.Do you think it is strange for them ? __eou__ No . Well , I don't know.But Taiwan is so crowded . Don't you miss life in America ? __eou__
Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ Why would that be funny ? __eou__ Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . __eou__ Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , whatever . __eou__
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . __eou__
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? __eou__ Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . __eou__ Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . __eou__
Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! __eou__ I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... __eou__ Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? __eou__ Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . __eou__ I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . __eou__
Would you travel around the world if you had the money ? __eou__ At the drop of a hat . __eou__
How was your business trip ? __eou__ Great - they wined and dined us all week . __eou__
This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . __eou__ What are you planning to do today ? __eou__ I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . __eou__ Have you done windsurfing before ? __eou__ No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . __eou__ Can you take a little advice from a friend ? __eou__ Sure . What ? __eou__ Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . __eou__ But I always wanted to try it . __eou__ Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . __eou__ Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ? __eou__
... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? __eou__ Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine . __eou__ You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? __eou__ But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . __eou__ He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . __eou__ Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . __eou__ But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up ! __eou__ You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... __eou__ No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ... __eou__ do you hear something ? __eou__
I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat . __eou__ That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? __eou__ Perfect ! __eou__ Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time . __eou__ Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . __eou__
Nick ! How ’ s it going ? __eou__ Oh , hey ... __eou__ What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? __eou__ Actually , my office is right around the corner . __eou__ It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . __eou__ Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? __eou__ You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? __eou__ Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . __eou__
Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ? __eou__ No . I just went cold turkey , and I never smoked again . __eou__
Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? __eou__ No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . __eou__
Is your city a historical place ? __eou__ Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . __eou__ How did it grow into such a large place ? __eou__ Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . __eou__ As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . __eou__ Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . __eou__ I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . __eou__ Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . __eou__
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . __eou__ I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . __eou__ come on , nothing can be that bad . __eou__ but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . __eou__ ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? __eou__ I've fallen in love with my boss . __eou__ really ? Is he married ? __eou__ no , of course not . He is still single . __eou__ then what's your problem ? __eou__ I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__ oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__ worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__ office romance is very tricky . __eou__ it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . __eou__ cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . __eou__
how are you doing , Christopher ? __eou__ to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! __eou__ are you doing anything this weekend ? __eou__ I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! __eou__ are you available on Sunday ? __eou__ yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . __eou__ ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? __eou__ that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? __eou__ it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . __eou__ what should I bring with me ? __eou__ we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . __eou__ I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . __eou__ do you like surfing ? __eou__ I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ? __eou__ we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! __eou__ I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? __eou__ you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . __eou__ ok , where and when should I meet you ? __eou__ we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! __eou__
hello , Deva , how are you ? __eou__ can't complain . What about you ? __eou__ not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? __eou__ I've heard . She looks quite depressed . __eou__ Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__
how's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . __eou__ that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . __eou__ the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . __eou__ I see how that can get a bit annoying . __eou__ a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . __eou__ so what are you going to do about it ? __eou__ I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . __eou__ what do you think would make you happier ? __eou__ in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . __eou__ relationships can be confusing sometimes . __eou__ what would you do if you were me ? __eou__ I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! __eou__
Did you enjoy that new movie ? __eou__ That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . __eou__ Oh , what happened , Carole ? __eou__ I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . __eou__ What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . __eou__ Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? __eou__ Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? __eou__ His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . __eou__ I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . __eou__ I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . __eou__ Doesn't sound promising . __eou__ Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . __eou__ If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . __eou__ Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class . __eou__
Hi Paul . How are you , friend . __eou__ Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . __eou__ Have you talk to him about it ? __eou__ Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night __eou__ Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight . __eou__ This is no laughing matter , Nick . __eou__ Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ? __eou__ He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer . __eou__ Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ? __eou__
how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? __eou__ I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . __eou__ as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? __eou__ well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__ you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__ you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? __eou__ taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . __eou__ I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! __eou__ you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__ you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . __eou__ besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . __eou__ that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! __eou__ good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! __eou__
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? __eou__ no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? __eou__ what about a factory tour ? __eou__ you mean visit a factory ? __eou__ yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__ good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__ really ? What do the companies do that for ? __eou__ I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__ oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__ exactly . __eou__ do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__ I'll call the tourist information centre to check . __eou__
who are you writing a letter to ? __eou__ I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? __eou__ OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . __eou__ that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? __eou__ well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . __eou__ you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? __eou__ just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . __eou__ congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! __eou__ shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? __eou__ ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! __eou__ it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . __eou__ ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . __eou__ I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . __eou__ that's thoughtful of you . __eou__ and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . __eou__ that's right ! I almost forgot about that . __eou__ what would you do without me ? __eou__ we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! __eou__
Is that your phone ? __eou__ yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? __eou__ it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? __eou__ yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__ that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__ yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? __eou__ no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__ does it have a camera ? __eou__ of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? __eou__ I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . __eou__ sure . Here you go . __eou__ have you checked your voicemail recently ? __eou__ no , why ? __eou__ I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . __eou__ oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . __eou__ do you want to listen to your messages first ? __eou__ no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later . __eou__ I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . __eou__ I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ? __eou__ it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . __eou__ how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? __eou__ it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! __eou__ let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age ! __eou__
hello . Where are you headed today ? __eou__ I'm off to Barcelona for a week . __eou__ do you have your passport with you ? __eou__ yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? __eou__ fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . __eou__ that's good advice . __eou__ would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__ are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? __eou__ let me see here ... yes , there's one left . __eou__ ok . I'll take that one then . __eou__ alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? __eou__ I like to travel light so I just have this one . __eou__ if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? __eou__ yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? __eou__ you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! __eou__
hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ everything's great . And you ? __eou__ same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . __eou__ oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__ it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . __eou__ well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . __eou__ I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . __eou__ I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . __eou__
hi , betty ! __eou__ hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? __eou__ pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . __eou__ that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ? __eou__ well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don __eou__ that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . __eou__ indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . __eou__ that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . __eou__ true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . __eou__ well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . __eou__ yeah it is . __eou__
hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . __eou__ what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . __eou__ oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? __eou__ actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? __eou__ art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . __eou__ really impressive . These two genres are totally different . __eou__ sure . I enjoy both of them very much . __eou__ how often do you go to the cinema ? __eou__ once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . __eou__ movie salon ? where is that ? __eou__ it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . __eou__ is it good ? __eou__ yes , you can find almost all new releases there . __eou__ really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . __eou__ why not ? __eou__
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__ why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ isn't there anything else ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ you must have a high IQ score . __eou__ well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ my IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__ seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__ maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ let's go ! __eou__
finally we're on board ! __eou__ yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . __eou__ are they window seats or aisle seats ? __eou__ let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . __eou__ ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . __eou__ that's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . __eou__ thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? __eou__ I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . __eou__ good idea . __eou__ don't forget to keep the seat belt on . __eou__ ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . __eou__ yes ! __eou__ and no hijackers . __eou__ oh , you have too wild of an imagination . __eou__
what's your apartment like ? __eou__ it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__ what is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__ it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__ did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__ no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__ do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__ no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__ how long is your contract for ? __eou__ that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__ have you started looking again yet ? __eou__ not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . __eou__ hey , Isabelle ... __eou__ Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__ yes , I am the guy . __eou__ what a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__ let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__ how dare you ! __eou__ hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__ why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__ I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__ I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__ I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . __eou__
do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? __eou__ sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? __eou__ I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . __eou__ that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? __eou__ I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . __eou__ if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? __eou__ I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . __eou__ you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . __eou__ the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . __eou__ the Taj it is then . __eou__ shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? __eou__ they'll still charge us a corkage fee . __eou__ that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . __eou__ don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . __eou__ are you sure ? We could go Dutch . __eou__ no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . __eou__ I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! __eou__
have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? __eou__ no . what's it like ? __eou__ it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through __eou__ would you want to live there ? __eou__ I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro __eou__ what's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__ my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . __eou__ would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__ old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . __eou__ it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ? __eou__ no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__ I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__ no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a __eou__
Can you play baseball with me today ? __eou__ No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow . __eou__ Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ? __eou__ No , it's not far . It's near our old house . __eou__ Can I help you pack ? __eou__ Sure . Thanks . __eou__
Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages . __eou__ Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you . __eou__ I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ? __eou__ Just fine . How is everything with you ? __eou__ Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ? __eou__ I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch . __eou__ OK , next time you ’ re here . __eou__ That ’ s a deal . __eou__ I heard that you moved to Florida . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches . __eou__ Tell me more . __eou__ The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright . __eou__ Sounds great ! __eou__ I ’ m pretty happy living there . __eou__ I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to all of them . __eou__ I ’ m jealous . I ’ Ve never been to Florida . __eou__ The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting . Come down for a vacation sometime . I ’ ll take you to Disney World . __eou__ That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation . __eou__ I hope you do . And keep in touch , OK ? __eou__ I sure will . __eou__ Here ’ s my business card . Send me an email once in a while . __eou__ Count on it . And here ’ s my card . Don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ d better get going . I don ’ t want to be late for lunch . Mom would worry . __eou__ Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip . __eou__ Take good care of yourself , Mary . __eou__ I will . Good-bye . __eou__ Bye-bye ! __eou__
what date is it today ? __eou__ why ? __eou__ look at the girls in the street . They all have bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? __eou__ Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . __eou__ did you have a fight with Jack ? __eou__ no , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? __eou__ come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . __eou__ you know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . __eou__ is that your phone ? __eou__ oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . __eou__ wow ! good timing . __eou__ he asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? __eou__ come on ! three's a crowd ! __eou__ so what ? __eou__ just go ! it's Valentine's Day ! __eou__
If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . __eou__ Would you ? I wouldn't . __eou__ What would you do ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . __eou__ One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . __eou__ Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? __eou__ As I said , I'd go round the world . __eou__ What would you do after that ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . __eou__ It doesn't sound very exciting . __eou__ Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? __eou__ I'd be happy if I got a rise . __eou__ And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . __eou__ Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . __eou__ What'll you have ? __eou__ I'll have a pint of the best . __eou__ I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . __eou__ All right . Make it a double , will you ? __eou__
Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? __eou__ He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish __eou__ Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they ? Does he like it ? __eou__ School , you mean ? Yes , he does . He likes his teachers , and that always makes difference . __eou__ Yes , it does . Does he go to school by bus ? __eou__ No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together . __eou__ What does he do when it rains ? __eou__ My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office . __eou__
Julie , what's on the tube ? __eou__ nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__ yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . __eou__ okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . __eou__ it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . __eou__ alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__ oh , what is it ? __eou__ it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__ oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__ yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__ I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . __eou__ cool . __eou__
I heard you received a prize for you book . __eou__ yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . __eou__ congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . __eou__ actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . __eou__ what was the prize ? __eou__ I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . __eou__ that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? __eou__ I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . __eou__ I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! __eou__
I ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend . __eou__ I hope that I can finally find free time too . I ’ Ve been so busy at work recently . __eou__ How might you spend the weekend . __eou__ I hope to do a little gardening . I find it very relaxing . __eou__ I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf . __eou__ I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely . __eou__ Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends . __eou__ Of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true . __eou__ Unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention . __eou__
Which sports are popular in your country ? __eou__ Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . __eou__ Do many people like tennis ? __eou__ More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__ In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__ Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . __eou__ I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . __eou__ A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . __eou__ There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . __eou__
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__ What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . __eou__

Hello , Jim . Where are you going ? __eou__ To the cinema . What about coming with me ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm going home . My wife's expecting me . __eou__ What a pity . I believe it's a very good film . __eou__ Do you go to the cinema a lot ? __eou__ Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly __eou__ Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? __eou__ No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home . __eou__ Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? __eou__ I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know . __eou__ Oh , does she ? That's convenient . __eou__ Yes , but I want to go to the country . __eou__ Don't you like the sea ? __eou__ Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ? __eou__ I'm going to stay at home . __eou__ Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ? __eou__ No , I want to buy a car , and that's going to take every penny I've got . __eou__
It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , isn't it . __eou__ Do you now the temperature today ? __eou__ It's beautiful 75 degrees . __eou__ How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__ Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__ What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . __eou__ I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . __eou__ That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . __eou__
You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window . __eou__ Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed . __eou__
We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? __eou__ Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . __eou__
You know them ? __eou__ No , but those guys like to hit on me . __eou__
Can you recognize that woman , Millie ? __eou__ I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress . __eou__ I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ? __eou__ That must be Conrad Reeves . __eou__ Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? __eou__ No , He must be her fourth or fifth . __eou__ Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! __eou__ She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . __eou__ I ’ m sure she is . __eou__ She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl . __eou__ That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__ Not that long ago ! I ’ m not more than twenty-nine myself . __eou__
Where do you come from ? __eou__ I come from Greece . __eou__ What's the climate like in your country ? __eou__ It's very pleasant . __eou__ What's the weather like in spring ? __eou__ It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes . __eou__ What's it like in summer ? __eou__ It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day . __eou__ Is it cold or warm in autumn ? __eou__ It's always warm in September and October .

Shall I make some coffee , Jane ? __eou__ That's a good idea , Charlotte . __eou__ It's ready . Do you want any milk ? __eou__ Just a little please . __eou__ What about some sugar ? Two teaspoonfuls ? __eou__ No , less than that . One and a half teaspoonfuls please . That's enough for me . That was very nice . __eou__ Would you like some more ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'd like a cigarette , too . May I have one ? __eou__ Of course . I think there are a few in that box . __eou__ I'm afraid it's empty . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__ Have a biscuit instead . Eat more and smoke less ! __eou__ That's very good advice ! __eou__
What kind of life do you prefer , city life or country life ? __eou__ In comparison to city life , the country life is quiet and peaceful . __eou__ But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city . __eou__ Yeah , I agree.Every wall has two sides . __eou__
If one is rich , is the happy ? __eou__ I don't think so.It ' s impossible to equate wealth and happiness . __eou__ Could I understand what you said as the poorest is the happiest ? __eou__ Of course not.Sometimes a poor man can be extremely miserable . __eou__
May , I saw a beautiful cotton down coat in the shopping mail . __eou__ Are you kidding ? It ’ s summer . __eou__
Could you please stop flipping the channels ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry . __eou__
Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me . __eou__ OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will . __eou__ Take care of yourself . __eou__
Have you heard about John ’ s obscene words towards the manager ? __eou__ Yes , but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him . __eou__
What ’ s your attitude when do wrong things at work ? __eou__ The buck stops here . __eou__
Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday . __eou__ I see.That ’ s all right . Don ’ t put the blame on yourself . __eou__
I am sorry . I didn ’ t accomplish the job on time . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well . __eou__
I firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money . __eou__ All wet.You are such a fool . __eou__
What ’ s up ? You look so blue . __eou__ Unfortunately , I missed a chance to see a classic movie . __eou__
Yo baby , are you satisfied with the costume show in the street ? __eou__ It ’ s hard to say.Just so-so . __eou__
Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired . __eou__ Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . __eou__
Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ? __eou__ It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . __eou__ Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? __eou__ Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend . __eou__ I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something . __eou__
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ My immediate family is quite small . It's just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . How about you ? __eou__ I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents . __eou__ I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? __eou__ We're identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else ! __eou__ Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? __eou__ We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn't mention to your biological father . __eou__ I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . __eou__ What about your step-brother's mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? __eou__ No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . __eou__ Sounds like it was ment to be . __eou__
Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? __eou__ That depends . What does she look like ? __eou__ Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . __eou__ How tall is she ? __eou__ She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . __eou__ Is she chubby ? __eou__ Not at all . She's actually very athletic . __eou__ It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No , but she does wear contact lenses . __eou__ How's her skin ? __eou__ She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . __eou__ Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? __eou__ I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos __eou__ What's the tattoo on her foot like ? __eou__ It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one . __eou__ Even her mom ? __eou__ Yes , even her mom . __eou__ What's her personality like ? __eou__ She's a lot like me . __eou__ So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! __eou__
Hello , John . How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine , thanks . And you ? __eou__ Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? __eou__ Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . __eou__ What have you been doing ? __eou__ I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . __eou__ Really ? Good luck for them . __eou__ Thanks . And how are your parents ? __eou__ They're both very well , thanks . __eou__ Where are you going now ? __eou__ I'm going to do some shopping . Why don't you come with me ? __eou__ I can't . I have to meet someone . __eou__ It's been nice talking to you . __eou__ Good-bye . See you again sometime . __eou__
Wish you have a blast . __eou__ Thank you . See you . __eou__
After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left . __eou__ Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . __eou__
What's the weather forecast for today ? __eou__ Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . __eou__ Any rain ? __eou__ No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . __eou__ I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . __eou__
Daniel . Mind your eye ! __eou__ I will , mom . Don ’ t worry . __eou__
Did you order the cake ? __eou__ Oh , I forgot . __eou__ Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . __eou__ Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” __eou__ I ’ m on it ! __eou__
Congratulations on the new house ! __eou__ Thanks ! We love it . __eou__ Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . __eou__ I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! __eou__
what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ? __eou__ I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions . __eou__ homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ? __eou__ I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry . __eou__ that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ? __eou__ almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash . __eou__ it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now . __eou__ the cost of living in London is just too high for most people . __eou__ it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . __eou__ did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ? __eou__ there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble . __eou__ added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . __eou__ something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . __eou__ politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class . __eou__ I can only hope that one day they will change . __eou__
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? __eou__ why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . __eou__ well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__ do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? __eou__ no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . __eou__ it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . __eou__ religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__ what do you think about abortion ? __eou__ I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . __eou__ do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? __eou__ I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . __eou__ why not ? It's their children , too . __eou__ that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . __eou__ that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . __eou__
how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? __eou__ I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! __eou__
Do you have any more questions ? __eou__ No , sir . __eou__ Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone . __eou__ Good-bye , sir __eou__
Who's calling , please ? __eou__ This is John . __eou__ What is it , John ? __eou__ I wonder if I can use your bike . __eou__
I need to go to the bank . __eou__ But they are closed today . __eou__ Closed ? Are you kidding ? What is it , some kind of holiday today ? __eou__ Have you already forgotten ? What's the date today ? __eou__ Oh , it's the first of April , April fool's day __eou__ You forgot all about it , didn't you ? __eou__ So I have , but I has reminded me at least one thing I need to remember . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . __eou__ Better not forget that , so kill you if you don't get her something . __eou__
How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . __eou__ Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! __eou__ Sure , why not ? I could use a rest . __eou__
Hi there , Philip . How ’ s everything going ? __eou__ It ’ s going pretty well , but I ’ m really tired ! __eou__ I don ’ t blame you . You ’ Ve had a busy first week . Take a rest ! __eou__ It ’ s all right . I don ’ t mind being busy ! __eou__
I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there . __eou__ Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! __eou__ Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! __eou__
How are you wedding plans going ? __eou__ Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress . __eou__ When will that be ready ? __eou__ The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks . __eou__ You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything . __eou__ Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious . __eou__ Which hotel will the reception be held at ? __eou__ The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job . __eou__ Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people . __eou__ I think you make the right decision . __eou__
What's the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment . __eou__ How's your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It's almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
Are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? __eou__ If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ? __eou__ Are you taking anything ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much . __eou__ Helen gets on very well with her neighbors . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . __eou__ I ’ m really looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! __eou__ Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at helen ’ s . __eou__
good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ? __eou__ yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . __eou__ certainly .

Do you intend to order a la carte or will you be having our seafood buffet ? __eou__ oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good . __eou__
Could you tell me your education background ? __eou__ Sure . Where shall I begin ? __eou__ Where did you go to university ? __eou__ I went to the university of Ohio , in America . __eou__ What degree did you get ? __eou__ I got a bachelor ’ s degree . __eou__ What was your major ? __eou__ I majored in English and minored in Chinese . __eou__ What was you G . P . A ? __eou__ I graduated with honors ; I had a 3.9 . __eou__ Do you plan to pursue further education ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ d like to obtain a master ’ s degree in international relations . __eou__ When do you think you will do that ? __eou__ After I have 3-4 years of work experience . __eou__ I see . __eou__

You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! __eou__ Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . __eou__ They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . __eou__ They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . __eou__
I had a great time on the last date . __eou__ Me , too . __eou__ What will you up to this weekend ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ would you like to go to skating ? I was thinking of going out to the - - Saturday . It's great up there . Would you like to go with me ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I don't care for skating very much . __eou__ Ok , there is a bunch of going bowling on Sunday . Would you like to go ? __eou__ I like bowling , but I prefer to be along with you . __eou__ Would you like to dancing tonight ? __eou__ I don't feel like going out tonight , I am way too tired . I miss you , sweetheart . __eou__ I miss you too . Tell me where you like to do the next day . __eou__ How about the seaside ? __eou__ Anything you say , honey . __eou__ Are you busy on the 24th ? __eou__ 24th ? I have time . But I can't wait that long , I'm dying to see you . Let's make another time . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Hello , who is speaking ? __eou__ Hello , this is John . I want to speak to Linda . __eou__ This is her . __eou__ Hi , Linda , I'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening . __eou__ Really ? What time and where ? __eou__ 7:30 PM at London-Chinese restaurant . I \ ' ll be at your place at seven to pick you up if you need a ride . __eou__ Yes , please , I'll need a ride . I'll be waiting for you then . __eou__ See you tomorrow at seven . Make sure your dress a little formally . I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale . __eou__ Thank you , see you then . __eou__ See you . __eou__

Kate , you never believe what's happened . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Masha and Hero are getting divorced . __eou__ You are kidding . What happened ? __eou__ Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . __eou__ That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? __eou__ Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . __eou__ That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? __eou__ Early in the New Year I guess . __eou__
Haven't run into you for ages ! __eou__ It really is.You ' Ve changed so much . __eou__ Really ? __eou__
Small world , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , it is . __eou__ I never imagined meeting you here . __eou__ It's really a surprise . __eou__

Julia and Anne have both taken dance lessons.They want to be famous dancer , I think . __eou__ Yet Julia is not a patch on Anne because she's not as diligent and clever as Anne . __eou__ I don't see much difference , anyway . __eou__
Why didn't you go to school yesterday ? __eou__ I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well . __eou__ What was your problem ? __eou__ My stomach was bothering me . __eou__ Are you feeling any better ? __eou__ I'm still feeling a little sick . __eou__ I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ? __eou__ I'd appreciate that . __eou__
Don't you think it's nice out ? __eou__ Yes , I think so too . __eou__ I think that it's going to rain . __eou__ I hope that it does rain . __eou__ You like the rain ? __eou__ The sky looks so clean after it rains . I love it . __eou__ I understand . Rain does make it smell cleaner . __eou__ I love most how it is at night after it rains . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains . __eou__ I would love for it to rain today . __eou__ I would too . __eou__
Hi , I am looking for a woman named Mia . __eou__ I think I am who you are looking for . You have got to be Rubin . __eou__ That would be me ! __eou__ Rubin ! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before . __eou__ I hope that what they had to say was mostly good ! __eou__ They only said wonderful things about you . You did a good job of finding me . __eou__ Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard . __eou__ Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons ! __eou__ I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe . __eou__ Lunch sounds great ! Let's head on out ! __eou__
It's very kind of you to show me around . __eou__ Not at all . What would you like to see first ? __eou__ I really don't know . __eou__ Let's walk around the lake first , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , that would be lovely . __eou__ Have you been here before ? __eou__ No , it's the first time I've been here . __eou__ I will take you to Li River after walking around here . __eou__ That's wonderful ! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful ! __eou__ Yes , you'll be in a different world there . __eou__

Oh hi , Linda , this is Todd . __eou__ Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice ! __eou__ Linda , I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last Friday . __eou__ I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd . __eou__ I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday . __eou__ Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ? __eou__ A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along . __eou__ I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ? __eou__ Nine would be good , don't you think ? __eou__ Nine is good . See you on Saturday ! __eou__

Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail ? __eou__ Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion . __eou__ Fine then , what time are we going to leave ? __eou__ I was thinking maybe 9 o'clock or so , so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad . __eou__ Nine would be perfect . I'll see you then ! __eou__
John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year . __eou__ I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska . __eou__ You can't be serious ! __eou__ Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . __eou__ After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . __eou__ Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . __eou__ You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! __eou__ Whatever you say ! __eou__
What's up ? __eou__ Nothing much , what's going on ? __eou__ I'm having a party this Friday . __eou__ Oh , really ? That's nice . __eou__ I wanted to see if you wanted to come . __eou__ This Friday ? Sorry , I already have plans . __eou__ Doing what ? __eou__ I'm going to dinner with my family . __eou__ I really wanted you to come , but I understand . __eou__ Yeah , maybe next time . __eou__ I'll hold you to that . __eou__ Sounds like a plan . __eou__
What's going on with you ? __eou__ Nothing . What's going on with you ? __eou__ I'm having a party this Friday . __eou__ I had no idea . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ I didn't hear anything about it . __eou__ Can you go ? __eou__ What time ? __eou__ It starts at 8 o'clock . __eou__ I'll go . __eou__ I hope that I'll see you there . __eou__ No doubt . __eou__
What's your favorite movie ? __eou__ My favorite movie is Superbad . __eou__ Oh , why is that ? __eou__ It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen . __eou__ That's true . It is a very funny movie . __eou__ You've seen it before ? __eou__ Yes , I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters . __eou__ Didn't you laugh through the whole movie ? I did . __eou__ Me too . That movie brought tears to my eyes . __eou__ Mine too . __eou__ I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it . __eou__ Sure , let's go . __eou__
Tell me , what do you enjoy doing in your spare time ? __eou__ I enjoy drawing and painting . __eou__ You know how to draw and paint ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ When did you learn how to do that ? __eou__ I learned back in high school . __eou__ Oh , so you took an art class ? __eou__ Yeah , I loved that art class . __eou__ I see that you're pretty talented . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ I wish I had a talent like that . __eou__ I'm sure you have a talent . It's just hidden . __eou__

It's an ugly day today . __eou__ I know . I think it may rain . __eou__ It's the middle of summer , it shouldn't rain today . __eou__ That would be weird . __eou__ Yeah , especially since it's ninety degrees outside . __eou__ I know , it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside . __eou__ Yes , it would be . __eou__ I really wish it wasn't so hot every day . __eou__ Me too . I can't wait until winter . __eou__ I like winter too , but sometimes it gets too cold . __eou__ I'd rather be cold than hot . __eou__ Me too . __eou__
Have you attended school today ? __eou__ I attended school today . Did you ? __eou__ I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that .

Hey George , how is your chicken ? __eou__ My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ? __eou__ My fish is pretty dry too . __eou__ It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . __eou__ Yes , it seems that way to me also . __eou__ How are your vegetables ? __eou__ My vegetables are very soggy . __eou__ Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . __eou__ I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter . __eou__ I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food . __eou__
Do you want some dessert ? __eou__ No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ Where is our waitress anyway ? __eou__ Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ? __eou__ I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . __eou__ Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . __eou__ So the bill is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . __eou__ I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . __eou__ Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . __eou__ I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . __eou__

Did you make it to school today ? __eou__ I always do . Did you go to school today ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ You should have , but have you seen any movies lately ? __eou__ That was an odd change of subject . __eou__ Maybe it was , but answer the question . __eou__ No , not recently . __eou__ I want to go to see a movie this weekend . __eou__ What's stopping you then ? __eou__ I don't want to go alone . __eou__ So , will you be at school tomorrow ? __eou__ No , I want to go to the movies instead . __eou__
All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon . __eou__ Great .

The total for our meal is $ 36.00 . __eou__ What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? __eou__ Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? __eou__ Yes , 20 % would be perfect . __eou__ Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 . __eou__ Yes , that was one fantastic meal ! __eou__ I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . __eou__
Do you want some dessert ? __eou__ No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ Oh , here comes our waitress with our check . __eou__ The service here has been really great , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , the service was quite good . __eou__ So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . __eou__ I agree that 20 % would be just about right . __eou__ OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 . __eou__ Yes , what a nice dinner that was ! __eou__ We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon . __eou__
Did you feed the puppies today ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__ That's good ! Just make sure to bathe them later . __eou__ No problem . I can do that for you . __eou__ Thank you !

Now tell me about the other alternatives . __eou__ Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . We're set up for wireless right here . __eou__ Great ! I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ? __eou__ Unfortunately , you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs . __eou__
Can I order something from the kitchen ? __eou__ Just tell me what you'd like , please . __eou__ A bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare would hit the spot . __eou__ I hate to tell you this , but we have no more filet mignon .

I need some more amenities , please . __eou__ I'm not sure I'm following you , sir . __eou__ Specifically , I'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo . __eou__ Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ? __eou__ No , I'm not even halfway through my supply . __eou__ I'm losing you , sir .

In a bus , all you see are the roads . __eou__ Even in Taiwan , I always liked to take the train . It is more comfortable . __eou__ I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired . __eou__ Look at that village ! __eou__ Beautiful . __eou__ Do you think I can take a picture through this window ? __eou__ I don't know if it will turn out good.The window might cause the picture to be blurry . __eou__

I hope the food here is good . __eou__ Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here . __eou__ But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star . __eou__ I think we might not see any . __eou__ Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ? __eou__ I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting . __eou__ I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ? __eou__ Yes , but I still think it could be better . __eou__
But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms . __eou__ No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . __eou__ Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . __eou__ I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . __eou__ So I can't take my gun then . __eou__ Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . __eou__ Yes , it's true I don't . __eou__ You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! __eou__ What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? __eou__ No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . __eou__ I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour . __eou__ Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . __eou__ First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning . __eou__ That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? __eou__ No , I'm fine . __eou__
My baggage is missing ! __eou__ Do you have air ticket and claim tag ? __eou__ Here they are . __eou__ Well , then , would you fill out this PIR from ?

I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ? __eou__ Since you have booked . Then let ’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand . __eou__

My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little . __eou__ How do you sleep ? __eou__ Very badly , doctor . __eou__ Do you find it difficult to get to sleep , or do you wake up early ? __eou__ Both , doctor . I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five . __eou__ Are you worried about anything ? __eou__ Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . __eou__ I see . please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch . __eou__ Yes , doctor . ( The doctor examines the patient ) __eou__ Well , there's nothing very much wrong with you , I'm glad to say.You ' re working too hard and worrying too much.Do you take much exercise ? __eou__ No , doctor . I never have enough time for exercise . I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . Then I can't get to sleep . Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ? __eou__ I can , but I'm not going to . You don't need medicine . You need advice . Don't work so hard . Too much work is bad for you . Don't worry about your work.It ' s silly to worry . Take regular exercise . __eou__ But I may lose my job , doctor ! It's hard to get a job like mine . __eou__ Then get an easier one , even if you earn less money . Which would you rather have , health or wealth ? __eou__ You're right , doctor . It's more important to be healthy than wealthy . I'll change my job . I'm grateful for your advice . __eou__ Come and see me again in a month's time . I think you'll be a different man ! __eou__
Hi , is this Professor Clark ’ s office ? __eou__ This is Professor Clark speaking . __eou__ Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class . __eou__ Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today . __eou__ My goodness !

Hi , the lab said that you would be getting my test results in today . __eou__ I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run . __eou__ I think that this is a bad sign . __eou__ For now , I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned . __eou__ Why wouldn ’ t you tell me over the phone ? __eou__ If there is any question about test results , we always do a recheck . __eou__ I need to come in right away . __eou__ I would be happy to see you this afternoon .

Good morning , how are you doing today ? __eou__ I have been feeling pretty good , Dr . Smith . __eou__ So , I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical . __eou__ Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam . __eou__ We are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . __eou__ I ’ Ve being kind of been having problems being out of breath .

I ’ ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Where are you feeling the pain ? __eou__ I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me ! __eou__ Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ? __eou__ It hurts smack in the middle of my gut ! __eou__ Did this just come on suddenly ? __eou__ I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over . __eou__ Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ? __eou__ No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches . __eou__ We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is . __eou__ I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you . __eou__

I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . __eou__ Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . __eou__ Is it gonna hurt ? __eou__ No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . __eou__ Ok , spit . __eou__
Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately . __eou__ Well , let me have a look .

I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ? __eou__ Will it take long ? __eou__ No , it'll be over soon . Nurse , get some X-rays of our patient's molars . Then we'll start . Open your mouth wide . Don't be so nervous .

Sorry the drugs on this order are out of stock . __eou__ What can I do ? __eou__ Would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ? __eou__ Could I ? __eou__ Certainly .

Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . __eou__ Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? __eou__ OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . __eou__ That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . __eou__ Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . __eou__

( After testing ) __eou__ Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to give it a try . __eou__ All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let ’ s go to his office . __eou__

What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ? __eou__ Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London . __eou__ What commission terms can you offer ? __eou__ Usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts . __eou__ Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? __eou__ Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? __eou__ Then I'll accept it with thanks . __eou__

Sir , I want to ask for a leave for five days . Here is the request form . __eou__ Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ? __eou__ Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion . __eou__ Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ? __eou__ Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar . __eou__ Well , I understand that . Your request is approved . Remember to give my best regards to your parents . __eou__
How much tea are you going to order ? __eou__ We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . __eou__ When do you want to deliver the goods ? __eou__ We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 . __eou__ I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . __eou__ I can agree to that . __eou__ Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 .

We will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here . __eou__ Good . And because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . __eou__ Well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new I will listen to what you have to say . __eou__ We want to make this a trial order . If we can sell all the products in two months , we will pay for them ; if not , we will send them back to you . __eou__ I can't agree to that . My company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back . __eou__ We promise that if the products are sold out in two months , we will place a repeat order right away , at the same quality . __eou__ OK , I agree . But the repeat order can't have the same terms . __eou__
Good morning . My name is Penny White . I'm new here . __eou__ Nice to meet you . My name is Tyler Smith . Let's go to your office desk , follow me please . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ? __eou__ Yes , that's OK . I'm glad to get started . __eou__ If you have any further questions , just ask me . __eou__ OK . Thank you very much . __eou__ You are welcome . Have a nice day . __eou__
OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . __eou__ Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . __eou__ I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? __eou__ Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . __eou__ So how do you intend to do that ? __eou__ OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . __eou__ May I interrupt you for a moment ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? __eou__ Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . __eou__ I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? __eou__ Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . __eou__
Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ? __eou__ This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ? __eou__ Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? __eou__ We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience . __eou__ Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ? __eou__ Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? __eou__ Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . __eou__
George , I heard our eighth generation computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contract with our company . You have done a good job . We are so proud of you . __eou__ Thank you . I never imagine that would happen . __eou__ Hah , as the sales department director , you are the best . __eou__ Thank you . But I am not sure whether the manager is settling for it . She asked me to go to her office . __eou__ Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize . __eou__ I feel nervous when I face Nova . __eou__ Come on ! What are you nervous about ? __eou__ You know the sales figure shows that the prediction has not achieved . __eou__ But the sales number is close to the predicted amount . __eou__ I'm still nervous . I don't know what to say to the manager . I always feel ill in that kind of place . __eou__ Take it easy . Be confident of yourself . I'm sure you can do it . __eou__
Why are you leaving your present job ? __eou__ I ’ m not so satisfied with it . __eou__ Why do you plan to change your job ? __eou__ I'm now a secretary in my present work unit . My work is not interesting . I have to type , make copies , book tickets and so on . Everyday I follow the routine . Furthermore , I have studied English for four years at university , but I can ’ t use it there . They are the reasons I plan to change my job . __eou__ Why are you interested in working with this company ? __eou__ One of my relatives told me that your company needs someone who can speak English . That's just the job that I have been looking for __eou__
Well , if you have no further questions , then we have done . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Owens , for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . I appreciate your coming . __eou__ When can I contact you about your final decision ? __eou__ We need to consider several other applicants and we hope to make a decision by the end of this month . We will call you regardless of whether you are hired or not . __eou__ Thanks a lot ! I will look forward to the good news . Please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning . __eou__ Well , I really appreciate your coming today . __eou__ The pleasure is mine . It ’ s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens . __eou__ Good-bye . __eou__

Now , if you ’ ll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . __eou__
What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ? __eou__ Dear friends .

I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ? __eou__ Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out . __eou__ OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % . __eou__ Can we add up this item to the agreement ? __eou__ Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement .

However , let me take a close look at the final draft . __eou__ Do you have some points to bring up ? __eou__ Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here . __eou__ Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides .

Hi , Bob , this is John Lin . __eou__ Hello , John . __eou__ I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services . __eou__ How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ? __eou__
What ’ s your major weak point ? __eou__ I haven ’ t been involved in international business , so I don ’ t have any experience . __eou__ What are you greatest strength ? __eou__ Honest , hardworking and responsible . __eou__ Does your present employer know you are looking for another job ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t discussed my career plan with my present employer , but I am sure he will understand . __eou__
You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? __eou__ We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . __eou__ If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? __eou__ I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . __eou__ I'm afraid that's too much for us . __eou__ We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . However , our company has the regulation for the agency . __eou__ All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . __eou__ You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . __eou__ Oh , that's pitiful . __eou__
Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU . __eou__ Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . __eou__ It's rather too high .

If people can not communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking . __eou__ Fortunately , there is a widely-spoken commercial language , namely English . __eou__ Many exporters speak French and German as well . __eou__ In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese . __eou__ Even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences . __eou__ Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character . __eou__ Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking . __eou__ So in foreign trade , you must be very clear about language differences . __eou__

But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . __eou__ Well , what about price ? __eou__ The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance . __eou__
Could you tell me which kind of payment you'll choose ? __eou__ We're going to pay by check . __eou__ Will you please have the check certified ? __eou__ If you think it is necessary . __eou__ It's just our policy .

Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . __eou__ The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . __eou__ In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 __eou__ Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . __eou__ How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? __eou__ Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . __eou__ As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ? __eou__ The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . __eou__ Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . __eou__ Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement . __eou__
Mr . Anderson , the boss wants to see you . __eou__ I'm on my way . __eou__
Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ? __eou__ It is because of the quality . __eou__ Could you tell me the particulars ? __eou__ I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . __eou__ Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified . __eou__ I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it . __eou__
Why isn't the project done yet ? __eou__ How should I know ? It's not my responsibility . __eou__
Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ? __eou__ I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups . __eou__ Are you more of a follower or a leader ? __eou__ I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together . __eou__ What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__ Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go . __eou__
Did you bring your certificate for nursing ? __eou__ Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse . __eou__ How about your nursing education ? __eou__ I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School . __eou__ Can you manage English conversation ? __eou__ Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school . __eou__
Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? __eou__ Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . __eou__ I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . __eou__ I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . __eou__ What's your proposal then ? __eou__ I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . __eou__ We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? __eou__ As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . __eou__ 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . __eou__ That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . __eou__ What's your counter-offer then ? __eou__ To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . __eou__ 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . __eou__ If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . __eou__ How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . __eou__ 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . __eou__ Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . __eou__ Ok . Let's call it a deal . __eou__
Good morning ! My name is John White , import manager of the Garden Trading Company of New York . __eou__ Oh , how do you to Mr . White ?

As you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle , we'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm . __eou__ We share the same desire .

How about your interview ? __eou__ They turned me down . __eou__ Why ? You are so excellent . __eou__ I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to . __eou__ What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them ! __eou__ It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies . __eou__ I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet . __eou__ On the Internet ? I've never heard of it . __eou__ It's very convenient and it has become popular recently . __eou__ Is that safe ? __eou__ Of course , if you log on some standard websites . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try . __eou__
Do you have a free moment ? __eou__ Sure . What do you need ? __eou__ I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? __eou__ Well , first you have to turn this switch on . __eou__ Silly me . __eou__ Now press this button . __eou__ Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? __eou__ Just a second . I'll go get some . __eou__
How many kinds of secretaries work here ? __eou__ There are 3 secretarial categories here .

What ’ s up ? __eou__ I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__ Yes , . Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? __eou__ Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__ Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__ I see . What can I do now ? __eou__ You can send a compressed one . __eou__
Did you hear something ? __eou__ Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . __eou__ It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__ You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__ Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Hao . I am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . Sorry . __eou__ Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview . __eou__ Maybe .

Good Morning Ann . __eou__ Good Morning Mr Jones . __eou__ How about a cup of coffee ? __eou__ I will make it now . __eou__ And can you tell me what meetings I have this week ? __eou__ I will bring the diary . __eou__ Okay , this afternoon you have a meeting with your accountant at 5 pm . __eou__ On Wednesday , you are going to London .

Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? __eou__ Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . __eou__ Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? __eou__ Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . __eou__ Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? __eou__ All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . __eou__ Okay , that's good . I get it . __eou__
I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . __eou__ You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . __eou__ I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . __eou__ Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . __eou__ I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . __eou__ You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . __eou__ Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . __eou__ In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . __eou__ Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . __eou__ I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . __eou__ You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . __eou__ I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . __eou__
Are you Miss Thou Ping ? __eou__ Yes . I am Thou Ping . __eou__ How do you spell you first name ? __eou__ Ping . P-I-N-G . __eou__ Do you have an English name ? __eou__ Yes , sir . It is Jane .

The post code is 220150 . __eou__ You look very young . How old are you ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m thirty now . __eou__ Where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Xinjiang . __eou__ What is your nationality ? __eou__ Han . __eou__
When can I know whether I am accepted or not ? __eou__ I think we'll send you a letter next week , if you are wanted , or we may give you a call . By the way , have you got a telephone ? __eou__ Yes , my office phone number is 373 ... 36 . __eou__ What's the best time to call you , then ? __eou__ Between four and five in the afternoon . __eou__ Thank you for coming , Miss Yang . __eou__ The pleasure is mine . It's been nice talking with you . Goodbye . __eou__
Would you like to travel ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I often went on business trips in the past six years . __eou__ How many languages can you speak in addition to your mother tongue ? __eou__ I speak English and French in addition to my mother tongue , Chinese . __eou__ That's fine . What salary do you get at your present position ? __eou__ My present monthly salary is $ 1,500 . __eou__ We'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20,000 a year , with bonuses that can add up to $ 40,000 . A company car , and a company pension scheme . Is that acceptable to you ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ Excellent . Well , thank you very much , Mr . B , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way . __eou__ Thank you . Mr . A , and I certainly hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . __eou__
Please come in and sit down . I'm happy to finally meet you . __eou__ Same here . I've been looking forward to this . __eou__ I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting so long . I'm running a little late today . __eou__ No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic . __eou__ Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ? __eou__ Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice . __eou__
What is your major ? __eou__ My major is Business Administration , I am especially interested in Marketing . __eou__ Which university are you attending ? __eou__ I attended Suzhou University . __eou__ Have you received any degrees ? __eou__ Yes . I received my Bachelor degree in Business Administration . __eou__ What course did you like best ? __eou__ Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work . __eou__ Do you feel that you have received a good general training ? __eou__ Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school . __eou__ English and computer skills are comparatively important to this post , especially in the starting period . Wharfs your ability in these two fields ? __eou__ I passed college English Test Band - 4 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer . I think , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I'm quite familiar with Microsoft Office __eou__
Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you . __eou__ How nice of him . I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? __eou__ If you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , I'll be at the hotel to pick you up . __eou__ That's great . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Rose . __eou__ It's my pleasure . Well , then . I'll say goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye and see you tonight . Miss Rose . __eou__
Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ? __eou__ Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end . __eou__ Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . __eou__ Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly . __eou__ Do you think the trend will continue ? __eou__ I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point . __eou__ Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . __eou__
What's your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical nine to five job . Actually , I work a little longer than nine to five most days . __eou__ Do you get paid overtime ? __eou__ No , I don't .

We can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn't mind , as long as we get our work done on time . __eou__ My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ? __eou__ There's some paperwork , but most of the time we put the information into our computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I don't like it very much . __eou__ I work in a cubicle too , but I don't mind it . __eou__
I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much . __eou__ I'm glad you like them . They are all made of silk . Here on display are all the most popular and favorite products . What items are you particularly interested in ? __eou__ 20 is very colorful and feels nice . I'd like to start with it . Is it pure silk ? __eou__ Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things . __eou__ Thank you for saying that . But what's the unit price ? __eou__ Here is the catalogue and the price list . You can take a look . __eou__ The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ That's fine . Then let's sign a contract . __eou__
Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? __eou__ We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . __eou__ What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . __eou__ No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . __eou__ What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? __eou__ We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . __eou__ You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? __eou__ We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . __eou__ I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . __eou__
To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . __eou__ Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June . __eou__ A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__ Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__ Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__ Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__ When will that be ? __eou__ Early next month . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L / CB __eou__ You can rest assured of that . __eou__
What certificates of technical qualification have you got ? __eou__ I have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate . __eou__ Have you worked in a computer company before ? __eou__ Oh , yes , I have .

Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . __eou__ Let ’ s see ...

Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . __eou__ I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . __eou__ I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . __eou__ People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . __eou__ The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . __eou__ Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . __eou__ I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . __eou__ Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you . __eou__
We're sorry , but we cannot allow your claim . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ The material was not damaged by us . __eou__ We'll have to talk this over some more . __eou__

Tristan , could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me ? __eou__ Sure .

They've even decided to come in on the weekend . __eou__ That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ? __eou__ We agreed that the deadline was next Friday . __eou__ Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . __eou__ That'd be very helpful .

Do you have your own circle of friends ? __eou__ Yes . I have friends even though I am a man of few words . Just like the old saying goes , " Actions speak louder than words " . I am a hard-working silent person . __eou__ What you said was right , but we need to work as a team , how could you make adjustment to that ? __eou__ Teamwork is ok to me , and I hope the team will be complementary in personality . __eou__ OK , I got it . __eou__

Without clear goals , one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future . __eou__ Tell me something about your goals . __eou__ As a graduate , it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work . And whatever job I may take , I will make the best efforts . __eou__ If confronted with difficult task , what will you do ? __eou__ I will make full use of the chance and get myself ready for the challenges all the time . __eou__ Would you care much about your salary ? __eou__ Salary is , admittedly , important , but I will care more about what I can learn from the job . __eou__ If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested , would you take it or not ? __eou__ I would take it . After all , interest is not the only thing one should care about . __eou__
You taught at a local school for a year , right ? __eou__ Yes , I was there as an English teacher . __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself there ? __eou__ Sure . I was fond of those lovely children __eou__ So why did you decide to resign ? __eou__ The school is a little bit too far away .

Mr . Li , does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting ? __eou__ Yes . In fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . The university and the business have a long-term relationship .

He thinks that I need to start being more creative . __eou__ Did he actually say that ? __eou__ Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . __eou__ Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? __eou__ No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . __eou__ Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yes , I do . If you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing . __eou__ Maybe you're right . Thanks , Don . I feel better . __eou__ I'm glad to hear it . __eou__

If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . __eou__ That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . __eou__
We cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview . Sometimes , my mind goes blank . __eou__ It is so terrible to be caught unaware . __eou__ Admittedly , you can get prepared in advance for the interview , but you cannot cover everything concerned . __eou__ Sure . So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply . __eou__ Firstly , your answer should go straight to the point , and be clear and brief . __eou__ State your opinion or argument first , and then go on with details . __eou__ Never should you give an answer completely beside the point . __eou__ If you indeed don't know how to answer , admit it frankly . __eou__ Pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule . __eou__ Confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly . __eou__ Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can . __eou__ It can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer . __eou__
Do you plan to further your study ? __eou__ Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics . __eou__ If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate .

Would you mind if I ask some personal questions ? __eou__ No . I don ’ t . Please . __eou__ Are you in robust health ? __eou__ I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet . __eou__
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__ Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . __eou__ I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__ I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__ I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__ Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__ Like this one ? __eou__ Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . __eou__ Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
Do you have anything in particular that you would like our firm to take into account ? __eou__ Yes , my house is far away from here . May I ask for an apartment ? __eou__ No problem . We will offer you a room with one bedroom and a kitchen .. __eou__ That's great . Thank you so much . __eou__
We have the orientation this afternoon . __eou__ What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? __eou__ The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . __eou__ Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , it is not easy . __eou__ It is OK with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . __eou__
Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . __eou__ It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . __eou__ You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . __eou__ The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . __eou__ Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . __eou__ To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . __eou__ Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . __eou__ It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . __eou__ You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . __eou__ While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately __eou__ Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . __eou__ Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . __eou__
Can you offer the Five Insurances for me ? __eou__ Yes , we have insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment , work injury and childbirth . __eou__ How are they get paid ? __eou__ Insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment will be paid by both the company and you , and the others by the company . __eou__

So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? __eou__ Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! __eou__ That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . __eou__ What was so bad about it ? __eou__ Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . __eou__ Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . __eou__ Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . __eou__
What is your long-term goal in this career ? __eou__ My long-term goal is to become an expert in this field . __eou__ What would you do to achieve that ? __eou__ In order to achieve that objective . I would work step by step and make further study . __eou__

Then I can do some shopping today before going back to my country . __eou__
Joe , can you squeeze me in sometime today ? __eou__ That's a big order , Jane .

Did you get my email ? __eou__ I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ How did the business trip go ? __eou__ Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . __eou__ I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__ I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! __eou__ Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . __eou__ I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . __eou__ I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . __eou__ Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! __eou__ No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? __eou__ No , should I have ? __eou__
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__ What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__ When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ You're right . If she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__ I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ On top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space.She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting . __eou__ That's true . I guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ Don't worry , we ’ ll find someone eventually ! __eou__
I have applied for a transfer . __eou__ Really ? Do you mean that you are leaving ? __eou__ Yes . I think it's time to move on . I ’ Ve already been here too long . __eou__ Where do you want to go ? __eou__ Well , I want to be transferred to the Shanghai office . __eou__ I will miss you . But anyway I wish you every success at your new post . __eou__ Thanks . It's been a pleasure working with you . __eou__

He can leave you alone this time . __eou__
I am thinking about resigning from my current job . __eou__ Have you thought about it seriously ? __eou__ Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . __eou__ Ok , did you find a new company ? __eou__ Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . __eou__ Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . __eou__ Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . __eou__
You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year . __eou__ Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . __eou__ Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . __eou__ If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . __eou__ Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . __eou__
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__ Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__ Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__
I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__ Then keep up the good work . __eou__

I'll start as soon as I get back to my office . __eou__ Here's a print out of the study , and this is a disc with the full report on it.The file name is product study , this is and extra copy so you can do whatever you want with it . __eou__

But I can only spare you an hour and a half today , from four o'clock . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__
I'm sorry , I'm engaged at 2 p . m . __eou__ If you don't mind , let's make it a little later.What about three or four ? __eou__ Sorry , the whole afternoon is filled up here.Will tomorrow do ? __eou__ All right . __eou__

But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? __eou__ The accounts department , I think . __eou__ The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . __eou__
OK . Here's the final drawing ! It's for the trip ! __eou__ And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! __eou__ Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! __eou__ Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up . __eou__ So , what did you win ? __eou__ A lousy desk lamp . And you ? __eou__ A bar of soap ! __eou__ Look at Vivian ! She thinks she's the cat's meow ! __eou__ Why don't you go talk to her and find out what her secret was this year . __eou__
Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? __eou__ Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! __eou__ I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . __eou__ Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . __eou__ It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . __eou__
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__ Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__ Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . __eou__ So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__ Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__ Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__
Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . __eou__ Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . __eou__ You wanna take some time off , is that right ? __eou__ Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . __eou__ What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . __eou__ I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? __eou__ Well , I guess so . __eou__
Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? __eou__ Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Do you mind if I sit down ? __eou__ Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? __eou__ Yes , but why should you want to do that ? __eou__ Do you mind if I speak frankly ? __eou__ Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? __eou__ Yes . I'd delighted if you did . __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__ Come in , please . __eou__ I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . __eou__ In 3 months or so . __eou__ You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__ Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__ You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I got the message . I'm quiting . __eou__ Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . __eou__ I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . __eou__ I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . __eou__ Very well , consider me gone . __eou__
Do you have a moment ? __eou__ Sure . What do you need ? __eou__ I'm having some trouble . I don't know how to use this printer . I've never seen this kind of office printer before . Is it a new brand ? __eou__ Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous . Well , first you have to turn this switch on . __eou__ Silly me ! __eou__ Now press this button . __eou__ Oh , it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? __eou__ Just a second . I'll go get some . Then you need to send the file . Make sure you choose the right printer . We have a few here and you're hooked up to all of them . __eou__ Which one is this ? __eou__ It's the Canon . __eou__
What kind of job are you interested in ? __eou__ I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work . __eou__ I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . __eou__ Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . __eou__ Have you had any experience as a guide ? __eou__ Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing . __eou__ Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing . __eou__ I think I would like that . __eou__
What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done . __eou__ Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . __eou__ What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__ I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better . __eou__ What kind of people do you like to work with ? __eou__ People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity . __eou__
Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__ So , what changed ? __eou__ Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__ Wow , a real step up ! __eou__ Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__ I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__ I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . __eou__
Why do you want to be a stewardess ? __eou__ I have always enjoyed flying . And I am good with people . __eou__ Could you handle flying for 24 hours straight ? __eou__ Yes , I can adjust to anything . __eou__ That's good . __eou__ I am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid . __eou__ You should very qualified . __eou__ Thank you . It has always been my dream to be a stewardess . __eou__

The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . __eou__ That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? __eou__ Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . __eou__ How often do you have meetings ? __eou__ You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects . Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each week . __eou__ I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together . __eou__ You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? __eou__ I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . __eou__ Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently . __eou__ That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . __eou__
We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? __eou__ That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? __eou__ See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . __eou__ Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . __eou__ The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . __eou__ Do you enjoy working in this office ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . __eou__ What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? __eou__ We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward suggestions and ideas . Be sure to speak up if you have any . __eou__
We have the orientation this afternoon . __eou__ What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? __eou__ The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . __eou__ Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , it is not easy . __eou__ It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . __eou__
Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__ Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . __eou__ Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__ When will we get one of those ? __eou__ You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . __eou__
I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . __eou__ To visit our supplier ? __eou__ Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__ Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__ No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . __eou__ Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . __eou__ I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__ I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . __eou__ I will call them this afternoon , thanks . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . __eou__
So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... __eou__ We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... __eou__ That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . __eou__
I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . __eou__ Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__ Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? __eou__ Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? __eou__ Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__ Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__ I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . __eou__ That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__ Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . __eou__ Ok , good luck to you . __eou__
We did a survey on your job performance . __eou__ How did I do ? __eou__ Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__ Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__ Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . __eou__ After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? __eou__ I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . __eou__ The basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . __eou__ It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? __eou__ 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. __eou__ Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? __eou__ We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . __eou__ Is there probation ? __eou__ No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week . __eou__
Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? __eou__ Go ahead , please . __eou__ How long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__ You ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__ What about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__ We will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__ How often is the bonus ? __eou__ You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__ Do I have training opportunities ? __eou__ We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer . __eou__ Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . __eou__ Ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board . __eou__ It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand . __eou__ I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . __eou__
Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . __eou__ Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? __eou__ Should each of us write separately ? __eou__ Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . __eou__
Mr . Thomas is making a long-distance call . Please wait for a few minutes . __eou__ Would you like some coffee or tea ? __eou__ Coffee would be fine . __eou__ How would you like your coffee ? __eou__ I like it black . __eou__ Coffee will be right with you . __eou__
We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__ Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ? __eou__ We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__ Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . __eou__
It is enough for today . Do you have any last question ? If not , thank you for taking your time to come to our interview . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time . __eou__ We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not . __eou__ Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__ Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__ Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . __eou__
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__ Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . __eou__ I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__ I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__ I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__ Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__ Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . __eou__ Why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__ According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__ I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__ No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . __eou__
Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . __eou__ If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . __eou__ We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . __eou__ We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? __eou__ I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . __eou__ I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . __eou__
What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ? __eou__ We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing , Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore and Tokyo , we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur . __eou__ What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ For instance , some products that do very well in Tokyo branch are a flop in Malaysia.We ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . Each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans . __eou__
Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . __eou__ Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . __eou__ Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? __eou__ We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . __eou__ So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? __eou__ We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . __eou__
Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? __eou__ Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . __eou__ But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? __eou__ Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . __eou__ It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? __eou__ Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . __eou__
Bob , can I talk to you for a minute ? There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about . __eou__ Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . __eou__ Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . __eou__ What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? __eou__ I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... __eou__ Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? __eou__ There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . __eou__
How come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__ You mean the network connection ? __eou__ Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . __eou__ I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__ So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__ Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__ Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__ Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . __eou__
Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . __eou__ Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? __eou__ Should each of us write separately ? __eou__ Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . __eou__
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__ Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . __eou__ Totally agree . What is your solution ? __eou__ Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . __eou__ You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__ It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__ But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__ I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . __eou__

Actually it's a routine board meeting . The things to be discussed are all written here . __eou__ Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . __eou__ Go ahead . It's for your reference . While you are at it , make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes . __eou__ You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself ? __eou__ Exactly . As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting , I don't want it to get out of control . __eou__ I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? __eou__ The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ? __eou__ Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday .

What kind of person do you think you are ? __eou__ Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . __eou__ What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ? __eou__ To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . __eou__ How do you spend your leisure time ? __eou__ I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies . __eou__ So , what kind of sport do you like most ? __eou__ Oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one .

I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__ No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__ Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? __eou__ Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__ Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... __eou__ That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__ Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__ Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__ Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__ I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__ Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? __eou__ It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy ; you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . __eou__
I know in your resume that you have worked in your present company for 3 years , can you tell me why you want to leave your present job and join us ? __eou__ Because the job I am doing in my present company is of no challenge , but I like challenge.Your firm is a young organisation with many innovative ideas . It has been very successful in an expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for . __eou__ Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? __eou__ I have excellent communication skills and I am familiar with the procedures for the last company I worked for . Besides , I am a team player and have great interpersonal skills . __eou__
How would you describe your ideal job ? __eou__ I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement . __eou__ Why do you think you might like to work for our company ? __eou__ I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field . __eou__ What makes you think you would be a success in this position ? __eou__ My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful . __eou__ How do you know about this company ? __eou__ Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company . __eou__
Anything else ? __eou__ Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? __eou__ Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year . __eou__ How about sick days ? __eou__ You get five paid sick days . __eou__ Any other benefits ? __eou__ Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . __eou__ Great . Thanks so much for your time . __eou__ We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . __eou__
Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions . __eou__ I hope they ’ re not too hard ! __eou__ Well , why should we hire you ? __eou__ I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company . __eou__ Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ? __eou__ I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now . __eou__ Great ... Well , let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview . We are short-listing our candidates this week , and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO . __eou__ Great , thanks a lot ! I hope to hear from you ! Good bye . __eou__
So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . __eou__ Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . __eou__ Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__ Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__ But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__ Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__ Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . __eou__
Is Betty Sue in her office ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Can I give her a message for you ? __eou__ Yes , please tell her I stopped by . __eou__ And your name , please ? __eou__ Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
What kind of jobs have you had ? __eou__ I have been a Production Manager . __eou__ How many years have you worked as a Production Manager ? __eou__ 3 years . __eou__ Would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements ? __eou__ I had introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost . __eou__ Wonderful . Then how many employers have you worked for ? __eou__ Frankly speaking , three . If your company employs me , it will be my fourth . __eou__ Then have you received any award at your present company ? __eou__ Yes . I was awarded the title of Advanced Worker last year . __eou__ How would you evaluate the company you are with ? __eou__ Although I could not say that everything is perfect there , I still very much appreciate what the company has given me , especial many chances . __eou__ How would your colleagues evaluate you ? __eou__ They would say I am a responsible friend and a capable colleague . __eou__ Can you get recommendations from your present employers ? __eou__ Yes , I have brought them with me . Here they are . __eou__ Do you have any questions ? __eou__ I think that you have covered all the important points already.But if I have any questions later I will contact you . __eou__
How long do you plan to stay here ? __eou__ To speak frankly , it doesn't depend on me . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ I really want to obtain a permanent job . I won't leave as long as I have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues . __eou__ What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? __eou__ I know that generally it is possible to move from this position to a management position with two years experience in the company __eou__
Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ? __eou__ What do you want to know ? __eou__ The usual , you know , something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent . __eou__ Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher . __eou__ Sounds as if you come from a professional family . __eou__ That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university . __eou__ What made you decide to get into computers ? __eou__ Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines . __eou__ Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ? __eou__ More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while . __eou__ It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week . __eou__ Thanks very much . __eou__
What is your name , please ? __eou__ My name is Sun lin . __eou__ How old are you ? __eou__ I am twenty-five years old . __eou__ May I ask your birth date ? __eou__ Yes , my birth date is September 22 , 1977 . __eou__ Where do you live now ? __eou__ I live at 606 Zhongguancun Road , Apt 802 , Beijing . __eou__ Then tell me your birthplace . __eou__ My birthplace is Nanjing . __eou__ Ok , I know you are not a resident of Beijing . Where is your domicile place then ? __eou__ My domicile place is Nanjing , too . __eou__
John , do you have a minute ? __eou__ Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office . __eou__ I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . __eou__ Has anybody spoken to him about it ? __eou__ No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . __eou__ We can ’ t really ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? __eou__ No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . __eou__ How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? __eou__ Oh , that would be too small . __eou__ With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . __eou__ Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . __eou__ Let ’ s rock n ’ roll . __eou__
Hello . Is this Ann ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Kelly ? __eou__ Yes , it's me . __eou__ Do you have a cold ? __eou__ No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . __eou__ Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? __eou__ I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . __eou__ I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? __eou__ Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . __eou__ Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? __eou__ Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . __eou__ Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__ It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__ Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__ That bad , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__ Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__ Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . __eou__ Hope you feel better . __eou__
Please switch work shifts with me . __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Why can't you ? __eou__ Because I have other obligations . __eou__
Let's start the interview with some questions . Tell me about yourself and your past experience . __eou__ I have 10 years financial industry experience , working for several companies . For the past two years , I have been working in an investment banking . In addition to my analytical mindset , I have a background of solid accounting principles . I am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . __eou__ What finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? __eou__ My background and experience include working on a variety of projects and jobs in the financial industry . Most of my experience has been behind the scenes , doing the calculations . I want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged . __eou__ Why did you leave your last position ? __eou__ I'm not finding the work as challenging as I used to . I want to find a job that is stimulating , where I can grow . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But by being aware of my tendency to overwork , I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime . __eou__ How would your boss describe you and your work style ? __eou__ She'd say I have a lot of initiative , I see the big picture and I do what has to be done . Second , I always meet deadlines . If I say I'm going to do something , I do it . Lastly , I have the ability to focus on what I'm working on I am not easily distracted . __eou__ What are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . Salary is not the most important factor to me . I'm looking for opportunity . __eou__ Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , I do . What do you see as the future trends for the industry ? __eou__
It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . __eou__ Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate . __eou__ So you must be an extravert ? __eou__ Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them . __eou__ What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? __eou__ A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment . __eou__ Don't you consider it a hard work ? __eou__ Hard but interesting , I think . __eou__ Have you any experience as a tourist guide ? __eou__ Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University . __eou__ Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ? __eou__ Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well . __eou__
Excuse me , could I ask a favour ? __eou__ Sure , go ahead . __eou__ Could you tell me where the canteen is ? __eou__ Sure , I can take you there actually . __eou__ Oh , I don't want to trouble you . __eou__ It's fine . I was heading there anyway . __eou__
How are you , Mr Wilson ? I am Tina . __eou__ Glad to meet you , Mrs.Tina . __eou__ Please have a seat .

I noticed an item about flex-time.Is that a possibility for me ? __eou__ Yes , it is , but you'll have to discuss the details with your manager . __eou__ That's acceptable . __eou__ Good.Now , if you'll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . __eou__
May I see you around 10 o'clock tomorrow morning , please ? __eou__ Certainly . Come to my office at ten ten . Be prompt , please . I've another appointment at 11 . __eou__ Don't worry . I'll be there right on time . __eou__
What kind of job do you think I should get ? __eou__ It all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life . __eou__
I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . __eou__ I'm not sure I can't agree , dan __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Surely , there are other ways to save money . __eou__ What are you talking about , we tried everything ! __eou__
Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? __eou__ Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . __eou__ Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? __eou__ It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? __eou__ The accounts department , I think . __eou__ The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . __eou__
Have you ever worked as a tour guide ? __eou__ I have a little experience . I guided a few foreign tourists around Beijing last year as a part-time job . I showed them to the Great Wall , the Imperial Palace , and the Summer Palace . __eou__ Then you may know that it's hard work . __eou__ Yes , I know . A friend of mine is a guide . He talked with me about his work , but I don't mind working hard . __eou__ Have you applied with any other companies ? __eou__ No , this is my first . __eou__ Is there anything you want to ask about ? __eou__ I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday . Would there ever be any chance of that ? __eou__ Certainly . There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company . Not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . Any questions ? __eou__ Yes . When can I get the decision ? I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . If I'd turned down , I ll have to secure a position elsewhere . __eou__ All right , then . We'll get in touch with you within a week . Thank you for coming today , Mr . Sun . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__ Good-bye . __eou__
Well , Yuri , tell me about it . __eou__ I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster . __eou__ That's what I was afraid of . __eou__ It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud . __eou__ Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . __eou__ That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site . __eou__ Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . __eou__ It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? __eou__ Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch . __eou__ Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible . __eou__ But sir ... __eou__ Yes , Yuri ? __eou__ I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe . __eou__ Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ? __eou__ No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir . __eou__ Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news . __eou__ You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported . __eou__ Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . __eou__ You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ? __eou__
Excuse me.May I see the manager of your store ? __eou__ I am the manager.Can I help you ? __eou__ Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me . __eou__ All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ? __eou__ I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year . __eou__ So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ? __eou__ At present , both are OK for me.What do you need most , then ? __eou__ Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here . __eou__ I think I can . I have been learning English for almost 5 years and especially I am fluent at speaking English.Also , I have made some foreigners friends during the experience of learning English . __eou__ That is fine . I think you have the qualifications needed for the job , so I will let you have the job.Does the work schedule suit you ? __eou__ It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm . __eou__ Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ? __eou__ It seems reasonable.By the way , I can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , can't I ? __eou__ Sure.You will get more if you can invite more customers with your good service . __eou__ I see . I will try my best to do the job well . __eou__ That is good of you to say so.When can you start working ? __eou__ How about next monday ? __eou__ Ok.Let ' s make is next Monday . I n the end , you need to fill out the application form . __eou__ Thank you for your kindness , ma'am . See you next Monday . __eou__
Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ? __eou__ Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please __eou__ May I know who's calling ? __eou__ This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited .

David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? __eou__ Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . __eou__ But they can see my resume . It's all in there . __eou__ I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . __eou__ Ok . What else ? __eou__ They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? __eou__ I see . What about the salary ? __eou__ Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . __eou__ Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot . __eou__ Anytime . Let me know how it works out . __eou__
Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ? __eou__ I'm sorry , he's out at the moment . __eou__ When do you expect him back ? __eou__ I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . __eou__ Well , may I leave a message ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? __eou__ Ok .

Mr . Emory ? I think it ’ s time to get a new computer . __eou__ Why , Christine ? I think the one we have is fine . __eou__ For the amount of work we do on the computer these days , the one we ’ re using is just too weak . We really need a higher model . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll think about it . I don ’ t know whether accounting is going to agree to such a big purchase . __eou__
You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today . __eou__ I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . __eou__ You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now . __eou__
Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . __eou__ I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick . __eou__ Well , I want a note from the doctor on this one . And , to be honest , if this continues , we may not be able to employ you here . __eou__ I understand , sir .

I really just have two problems with this . __eou__ Yes , sir ? __eou__ I ’ m concerned about your lack of marketing experience and , frankly , your age , you ’ re pretty new at all this . __eou__ I can understand that . Let me see if I can clarify some things for you . __eou__
Mr . Blake ? Mr . Foster ’ s on the phone . He ’ d like to know if you can send over those training manuals ? __eou__ Oh , tell him I ’ ll leave them at his office tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ He was hoping that you could drop them off this afternoon . __eou__ I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t do that . They ’ re at the printer ’ s being copied . They ’ ll be back tomorrow before 1 o ’ clock . __eou__
Jason . There ’ s a snag in the plans for the Hoover Center . __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I thought everything was set . __eou__ Well , it was . But the contractor ’ s just told me he ’ s not going to be able to finish by the twentieth , as planned . __eou__ Maybe we could work out an overtime schedule . It ’ s definitely worth it to finish by the twentieth . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Compton ? This is Susan Miller . __eou__ Hi , Susan . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I ’ d like to take tomorrow off if that ’ s all right with you . __eou__ Let me take a look . Just a second . That ’ s no problem , Susan . See you on Wednesday . __eou__

I ’ d like to talk to you for a second , please . __eou__ Okay , Mark , What ’ s up ? __eou__ I ’ d like to know why you ’ re always taking credit for work we ’ Ve done together like that line in the new Ice Cream ad ? __eou__ That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Hi , this is Sharon in Mr . Reynolds ’ s office . One of your delivery men picked up a package here about an hour ago . __eou__ Yes , is there a problem ? Ma ’ am ? __eou__ Well , it still hasn ’ t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned . __eou__
morning , Mary ? It ’ s John Kramer calling . You remember you handled my tax forms for me ? __eou__ Of course , Mr . Kramer . How are things going these days ? __eou__ Better than ever ! You won ’ t have to worry about “ finding ” extra money for me anymore ! We made nearly a quarter of million in profit last year ! __eou__ Congratulations ! I ’ m really glad to hear it !

Mail room . Karen speaking . __eou__ Hi , Karen . This is John Williams in the purchasing department . Can you check to see if there ’ s a package down there for me ? __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Williams . Just one moment , please . __eou__ Thanks , Karen . __eou__
Hi , is this Steven ? __eou__ No , ma ’ am . This is Sean . Steven ’ s out sick . __eou__ Oh , sorry to hear that . Listen , I ’ Ve got a rush order . Can you help me out ? __eou__
Print shop . Seam speaking . __eou__ Hi , Sean . It ’ s Mary in Mr . Emory ’ s office . I placed an order for 1,000 bound copies of a staff manual last week . __eou__ It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that . __eou__ Well , I was hoping you would do me a big favor . That was supposed to be a rush order , I forgot to tell you . I ’ m getting a lot of flak from my boss . __eou__
I would like to take my vacation next month . __eou__ How long did you have in mind ? __eou__ I would like to take my two weeks vacation time . __eou__ Seeing as next month is our slow season , that should not be a problem . __eou__ Great . I will make my reservations as necessary . __eou__ Just make sure to turn in all the necessary paperwork to ensure there are no problems with the days you want to take off . __eou__
I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . Do you think you can help me polish my interview style ? __eou__ Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off . __eou__ I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them . __eou__ Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves . __eou__ I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ? __eou__ No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention __eou__
Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design __eou__ I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__ Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t __eou__ That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? __eou__ Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . __eou__ I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . __eou__ Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con __eou__ So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . __eou__
I ’ m ready to settle the bill . __eou__ I hope you enjoyed your stay . __eou__ Definitely ! Very relaxing . __eou__ Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ What ? I only stayed three nights . __eou__ That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . __eou__ Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . __eou__ But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . __eou__ Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? __eou__ Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr . Dome ’ s office . __eou__ This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr . Dome at 4 o ’ clock . __eou__ Yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office . __eou__ Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s correct . __eou__ Ok . Thank you . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? __eou__ So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__ Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__ I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . __eou__ Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . __eou__
Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ? __eou__ Can ’ t complain . And you ? __eou__ Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ? __eou__ Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . __eou__ Great . __eou__
Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? __eou__ What ’ s to get ready ? __eou__ Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? __eou__ Nope . __eou__ Have you updated your CV ? __eou__ Nope . __eou__
how's your new job going ? __eou__ really well , thanks . __eou__ how are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__ would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ how about your new co-workers ? __eou__ they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__ do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ do you like working in teams ? __eou__ I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . __eou__
hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? __eou__ I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? __eou__ I'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . __eou__ have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? __eou__ no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__ not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? __eou__ yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__ do you have experience in the IT field ? __eou__ I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . __eou__ do you speak Spanish ? __eou__ yes , but not fluently . __eou__ that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? __eou__ I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__ did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__ no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . __eou__ I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . __eou__ thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! __eou__
do you have s second ? __eou__ sure . What do you want ? __eou__ I want to tell you I've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? Why ? __eou__ I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . __eou__ and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__ yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received __eou__ absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__ that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__ this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . __eou__ that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . __eou__ that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead __eou__
Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? __eou__ Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__ I see . And how about the working hours ? __eou__ Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__ Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__ Good , as long as you understand that . __eou__ And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? __eou__ Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__ That sounds ideal . __eou__
Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... __eou__ For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g __eou__ Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__ They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really __eou__ Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__ The London Weekly right . __eou__ Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . __eou__
We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? __eou__ That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? __eou__ See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . __eou__ Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . __eou__ The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . __eou__ Do you enjoy working in this office ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . __eou__ What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? __eou__ We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su __eou__
can you squeeze me in sometime today ? __eou__ That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . __eou__ I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . __eou__ Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ? __eou__
when are you going to give me those brochures ? __eou__ What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . __eou__ I know , but I want to make reservations this week . __eou__ Okay . I ’ ll bring them in tomorrow for sure . __eou__
Can you help me plan the office party ? __eou__ Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? __eou__ I need help with food . __eou__ OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ? __eou__ I think it should be casual . __eou__ I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? __eou__ I would prefer Chinese food for this party . __eou__ Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ? __eou__ I think we should hire a live band . __eou__ OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday . __eou__
Oh , my God ! What's this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Look ! This window is open . __eou__ Did you open it before we left ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? __eou__ I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? __eou__ No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . __eou__ It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__ I locked it when I left though . __eou__ Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . __eou__ I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! __eou__ Look around . __eou__ The TV's still here . __eou__ And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . __eou__ But what if someone's still up there ? __eou__ I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? __eou__
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer . __eou__
Excuse me . My bag was stolen , will you help me ? __eou__ When did it happen ? __eou__ Just about half an hour ago . __eou__ Tell me where it happened and how . __eou__ Yes , it was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper . __eou__ That happens often these days . Well , please fill in this Report of Theft . __eou__ I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy because my passport was in the stolen bag . __eou__
How does the political system work in your country ? __eou__ We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . __eou__ Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? __eou__ Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . __eou__ What ’ s a cabinet ? __eou__ This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . __eou__ Can any mp make a law ? __eou__ Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . __eou__ I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__ Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__ How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? __eou__ They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters . __eou__

How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country .

I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please . __eou__ Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ? __eou__ That might be a good idea , yes . __eou__ Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? __eou__ I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . __eou__ Actually , I have a suggestion for you .

But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me . __eou__
Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan . __eou__ OK , what does that entail ? __eou__ It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . __eou__ Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? __eou__ Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . __eou__ I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? __eou__ Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . __eou__ Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today . __eou__

I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . __eou__ The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... __eou__ Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . __eou__ That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? __eou__ Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . __eou__ What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! __eou__

It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . __eou__ I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? __eou__ That's right .

Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started . __eou__

The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China .

Thanks for your help , bye for now . __eou__

Did you get a good look at the suspect ? __eou__ I got a great look at him . __eou__ Do you think you could pick him out of a line-up ? __eou__ I can do that . __eou__ Could you please look at the five men in this line-up ? __eou__ All right . __eou__ Do you recognize the suspect ? __eou__ He's there . __eou__ What number ? __eou__ He's number four . __eou__ Thank you very much for your cooperation . __eou__ I'm glad to help . __eou__

Thank you . __eou__
Are you aware of the reason why I pulled you over ? __eou__ No , sir . __eou__ I pulled you over because your brake light is out . __eou__ I'm sorry . I did not know that . __eou__ I have to write you a ticket . __eou__ Can't you give me a warning ? __eou__ I'm not going to be able to do that . __eou__ How much will the fine be ? __eou__ You'll find that out on your court date . __eou__ I have to go to court over a brake light ? __eou__ That's how it works . __eou__ Can I have the ticket , please ? __eou__
You ’ re free to leave . __eou__ I ’ m so excited . __eou__ What are you planning on doing now ? __eou__ I ’ m going back to college . __eou__ What are you going to major in ? __eou__ I haven ’ t thought about it yet . __eou__ I don ’ t want to see you back here . __eou__ You won ’ t see me here again . __eou__ I don ’ t think this place is for you . __eou__ I know . __eou__ I wish you luck . __eou__ Thanks .

So , he was obviously lying . __eou__ Your license plate was caught on camera ? __eou__ A picture of my license plate was never taken . __eou__ Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go . __eou__ Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me . __eou__
What is your case against the police ? __eou__ They arrested me for nothing . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . __eou__ Didn ’ t they let you go ? __eou__ They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . __eou__ So they kept you at the station ? __eou__ They sure did . __eou__ Did they tell you why they arrested you ? __eou__ I matched the description of a robbery suspect . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ I want to take them to court . __eou__
I need order in the court ! __eou__ I am ready to make my plea . __eou__ What do you plead ? __eou__ I plead not guilty . __eou__ All the evidence indicates that you are guilty . __eou__ I realize that , but I am not guilty . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed . __eou__ Who is the guilty party ? __eou__ I ’ ll tell you if you let me go . __eou__ I ’ d be glad to make a deal with you . __eou__ I am willing to tell you that information . __eou__
hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ? __eou__ hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the pole __eou__ people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . __eou__ you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . __eou__ there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . __eou__ well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? __eou__ yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . __eou__ well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . __eou__ I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . __eou__ I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! __eou__ don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . __eou__
Good afternoon , how can I be of service today ? __eou__ My company wants to become involved in your Comprehensive Credit Granting . We are a very young company and I'm not at all sure if we meet your credit requirements . __eou__ It is possible to take into account special circumstances , should the manager agree to it . If your credit rating has been class A in your initial trading period and your debt to asset ratio is sound , and then I'm sure the manager will see you to discuss it further . I'll set up a meeting for you . __eou__ That would be wonderful . Thank you so much for all of your help . __eou__
Not only does it centralise management , it also increases the efficiency of funds . We have testimonials from various companies who are very happy with the service . __eou__ Yes , I'm sure you do . It sounds like an excellent service . __eou__ You see , nowadays , a lot of companies are concerned about their group account management . As long as your company meets all the requirements of our Group Account Deposit Service , I would fully recommend it . __eou__ It seems perfect . __eou__ Here are some leaflets detailing everything we've discussed . __eou__ Could you also let me view some of the testimonials ? I'd really be interested to see what other group companies thought of this service . __eou__
Let me tell you some more . The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter , It's paid quarterly . Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account . __eou__ Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ? __eou__ Well , the Type B Account is very restricted . If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account , I would recommend the Type A Account for you . __eou__ Thanks for your time . I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later . __eou__
Unfortunately , according to our regulations I have to confiscate these counterfeit notes . __eou__ So , this 500 RIB is worthless ? __eou__ I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so . __eou__ Right , I see . Let me give you another 500 RIB . __eou__ Here's your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 RIB worth of counterfeit notes . __eou__ Thanks . Now can I make the full deposit ? __eou__ Yes . Please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue . __eou__
Hi , I was wondering how I'd go about getting a credit card . __eou__ Certainly , Sir . You do have a Current Account with us right ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'm afraid I don't . Is that necessary ? __eou__ Yes , Sir . In order to get a credit card with us , you'll need to open a Current Account here . Could you please fill out this form with your relevant details ? __eou__ That's done . Do you need to see any credentials ? __eou__ Yes , a passport will be fine . __eou__ I don't have my passport on me at the moment . I'll just pop back to my office and pick it up . __eou__ That's fine , Sir . We'll see you again a little later . __eou__
Good afternoon . What can I help you with today ? __eou__ I have a Time Deposit here and I'd like to get the money now . __eou__ The maturity date isn't for another 10 weeks . Are you aware of that ? __eou__ Yes , I know , but I need the money urgently for a family emergency , you see . I know I should apply in writing if I wish to withdraw , but I'm afraid there just isn't time . __eou__ The regulations state that the interest is paid at the rate of a Current Deposit , so unfortunately you will lose some interest . __eou__ Well , it can't be helped . I really must have that money . Thank you . __eou__
Mr Moon , how good to see you again . __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? __eou__ Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . __eou__ What if I exceed ? __eou__ If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . __eou__ Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do . __eou__
Good day to you . How can I be of service today ? __eou__ Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account . __eou__ I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from __eou__ Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ? __eou__ Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ? __eou__ Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account . __eou__
Morning , Madam . This is the window for Foreign Exchange Savings . How can I help you ? __eou__ I want to save some US dollars into my account . __eou__ That's fine . Is it a Time Deposit ? __eou__ Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for . __eou__ Well , we offer 5 grades as standard __eou__ Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ? __eou__ For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % . __eou__ That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go . __eou__
Hello . Is everything OK ? Can I help you ? __eou__ Oh , wonderful ! You speak English ! I need to exchange this foreign currency . __eou__ That's no problem . Is it cash ? __eou__ It's Traveller's Cheques , is that possible ? __eou__ Of course . If you could sign your name on the bottom line here , and write your address here . And please sign and date the back of every cheque and of course I'll need to see your passport . __eou__ Yes , right , certainly . Here you go . __eou__
Would you like to know about benefits and so forth ? __eou__ Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something ! __eou__ With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly . __eou__ That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money . __eou__ Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that . If you are sure , we can go ahead now , Sir . How does 10 am tomorrow sound , to get all of the paperwork out of the way ? __eou__
Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes . I've received this Remittance Advice from the bank . __eou__ Could I take a look at it , please ? Let me just check these details ... right . __eou__ Mr CK Chen contacted me this morning and asked me to come in for the remittance . __eou__ I've got the details here . 10,000 RIB sent by Mr CK Chen from Guangzhou . Could I see some ID ? You passport , for example ? __eou__ Here you go . Can I deposit some into my account and take some in cash ? I need 1,000 RIB for my expenses , you see . __eou__ That's no problem . Could you please sign here ? Here's the 1,000 RIB in cash , your passport back , and the remaining balance has been deposited in your account . __eou__
Sir , are you alright ? Just try to calm down , Sir . What's happened ? __eou__ I've lost my Traveller's Cheques , all of them . __eou__ OK , just take a deep breath , Sir . Everything is going to be fine . Here's a form to report missing Traveller's Cheques , whatever the reason . Please fill it in and we can get moving on this . __eou__ I see . You need the reference numbers ? For each cheque ? __eou__ Yes , Sir . Do you have that information with you ? At this bank , we always recommend our customers write down the reference number of each Traveller's Cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the Traveller's Cheques . __eou__
Let's sell our stocks now . __eou__ Why ? They keep going up . __eou__ I have a feeling they're about to go down in a few days . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I need to have some money transferred from the UK , from my company . It's kind of an emergency . __eou__ That shouldn't be a problem , Madam . I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly . __eou__ That would be wonderful . The problem is I don't have an account with you . That is a problem , isn't it ? __eou__ Well , to be honest , it will slow things down a little . But it's not a big problem . You can do it by T / T . __eou__ T / T ? What on earth is that ! ? Sorry , but I've never heard of it . T / T ? __eou__ It means ' telegraphic transfer ' . So , if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world . __eou__
Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? __eou__ Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . __eou__ That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . __eou__ And I can purchase that here ? __eou__ Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . __eou__
Hello . Are you here to withdraw some money from your account at the Securities Company ? I'll need to see your Passbook for that account . __eou__ Right , here it is . __eou__ Thanks .

Then the transaction should be completed . __eou__ OK ... there we go . Thanks very much . __eou__

By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them . __eou__
Hi there . Do you need any help ? __eou__ I've been told about something called Southern Fund . How can I buy it ? __eou__ First of all , you should open a Fund Account with us , just fill in this form . We'll need to see some ID and your Cash Card . __eou__ That sounds simple enough . Do you charge any admin fees for that ? __eou__ You'll have to pay 20 RIB , and then you will have your Southern Fund Management company card . __eou__ Do you need any other documentation from me ? __eou__ Yes , we'll need to fill in this form , for fund trading and this one , for subscribing for and / or applying for purchasing fund units . The minimum is 500 RIB . __eou__
Good afternoon . Which service do you require . __eou__ I need to increase the amount of my L / C . It's quite a new one ; I opened it 12 days ago . __eou__ What you need to do is apply for an amendment on your existing L / C . __eou__ How do I go about that ? __eou__ You'll need to fill in this application form and there is a charge of 30 US dollars for this . __eou__ OK , you can take that from my account . I'll fill in the form now . __eou__ Thanks . Yes ... that's all in order . What we will do now is send the L / C amendment to the negotiating bank . As soon as we know anything , we'll contact you . __eou__
Hello . May I help you ? __eou__ Hi . Last month , our company , Turner Interiors of Beijing , ordered some documents under our new L / C . What I want to do is check and see if the documents have arrived yet . __eou__ Let me find that on my screen ... yes , the L / C is right here . I'm sorry ; the documents don't seem to be here yet . __eou__ Oh , dear . When do you think they will arrive ? __eou__ It should be around 5 working days , but different cases take different times . Sorry I can't be more precise . __eou__
IBA , how can I help ? __eou__ Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet . She recommended I sign up for this service too . __eou__ That was a wise decision , if I may say so . Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ... __eou__ I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller . __eou__ This will fix all of that for you . If you use our online payment service , the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account , in a secure way . __eou__
Hello , there . Welcome , and what can we assist you with ? __eou__ Good morning . I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here . I'd like to discount it .

Hello , is everything alright ? Can I help ? __eou__ I have a Promissory Note , but it's not called that . It's a Bill of Exchange . __eou__ Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . __eou__ So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? __eou__ That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . __eou__ I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out . __eou__ As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about . __eou__
Hello . What can we do for you ? __eou__ Hello , I'm here to talk to someone about a Fixed Asset Loan . __eou__ Certainly . That shouldn't be a problem .

We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability ... __eou__ Well , we have no problems with our credit rating , I can assure you . __eou__

When will it be paid in and credited to our account ? __eou__ It's already credited to your account . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Hello . Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'd like to open a savings account . Would you please give me some advice ? __eou__ Certainly , I'll be very happy to help you . Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals . __eou__ What's the difference between the two ? __eou__ If you open a fixed account , the interest rate is higher . __eou__ Then how about the current account ? __eou__ You may withdraw the money at any time . You just need to present your deposit book . __eou__ Thank you for your help . I think I'll open a current account . __eou__ OK . Do you have your ID card on you ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Good . Everything is done . Here is your deposit book and ID card . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ It's my pleasure . __eou__
Good afternoon . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to make a deposit . __eou__ Which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ? __eou__ I prefer time deposit . __eou__ Okey . The interest rate for time deposit is higher .

How long would you like to keep your deposit ? __eou__ Six months . __eou__ Fill in this slip in ink , please . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ All right . Just a moment , please . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hello again . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ Yes , I'm back ! It's nice to see you again . I'm here about those documents . __eou__ Ah yes , the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ? __eou__ That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? __eou__ Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... __eou__ Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee . __eou__ The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars . __eou__ That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem . __eou__
Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? __eou__ The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__ I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__ I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . __eou__ Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__ I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . __eou__ That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__ And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__ For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__ Wow ! A third more ? Very good . __eou__
How can I help you today , Sir ? __eou__ I set up the Personal Wealth Management Service with you , but I'm going to be travelling overseas . I'm not quite sure what I should do . I mean is it possible to still use the service ? __eou__ That's not a problem . You can use that service wherever you are , it doesn't matter which country you are in at the time . __eou__ Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ? __eou__ Of course . It's 33234 . That will put you in touch with a Personal Banker . __eou__ And they can deal with everything ? __eou__ That's the beauty of the service ; they can deal with everything , with total security . __eou__ That's good to know .

Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? __eou__ Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . __eou__ That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? __eou__ Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . __eou__ That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . __eou__
I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon . __eou__ Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . __eou__ I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . __eou__ All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . __eou__ Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . __eou__ We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . __eou__ Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . __eou__ The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . __eou__ As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . __eou__ Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . __eou__ 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__ I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . __eou__ It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow . __eou__
I wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . It's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers . __eou__ As a rule , we don't allow any discount . __eou__ But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . __eou__ That's true . But I am sorry I can't make an exception . We have quoted you our lowest price . We can't give you any more discounts . __eou__
We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks . __eou__ All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . __eou__ I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . __eou__ Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . __eou__ That's understood . __eou__
What arrangement will you make about payment ? __eou__ We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? __eou__ At sight of course . __eou__ Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . __eou__ I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . __eou__ But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__ We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . __eou__ That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . __eou__ Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__ If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . __eou__ Thank you . I am glad we have come to an agreement at last . __eou__
What kind of document is an invoice ? __eou__ It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . __eou__ How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? __eou__ Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice . __eou__ What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? __eou__ By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve come to inquire about a 6,000- dollar remittance from California . Has it arrived ? __eou__ May I have your name , please ? __eou__ My name is Jenny Clinton . __eou__ I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . __eou__ Really ? It should have arrived . It was sent a week ago . __eou__ If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . __eou__ Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow . __eou__ Or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? __eou__ That would be very kind of you . __eou__ Could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? __eou__ The phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . __eou__ Thank you . We'll inform you in time . Goodbye . __eou__
Put on the helmet , please . __eou__ Do we need to put on the jackets too ? __eou__ You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . __eou__ Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? __eou__ Well , not fully automated . __eou__ I see . How do you control the quality ? __eou__ All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . __eou__ What ’ s the monthly output ? __eou__ One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . __eou__ What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? __eou__ About 2 % in normal operations . __eou__ That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? __eou__ Yes . Shall we take a break now ? __eou__
This is our rock - bottom price , Mr . Li . We can't make any further concessions . __eou__ If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__ What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . __eou__ I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? __eou__ What is your proposal ? __eou__ Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . __eou__ Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . __eou__ What would you suggest ? __eou__ The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . __eou__ That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . __eou__ You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . __eou__ I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . __eou__ Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . __eou__ Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? __eou__ Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . __eou__ Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? __eou__ How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? __eou__ Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I would like to exchange some money . __eou__ what currency would you like to trade in ? __eou__ I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? __eou__ No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? __eou__ Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? __eou__ It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? __eou__ I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! __eou__
Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice . __eou__ Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__ So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? __eou__ Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? __eou__ Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . __eou__ Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . __eou__ Or a curse . __eou__ Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time . __eou__ That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . __eou__ Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? __eou__ Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . __eou__ You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? __eou__ I could , but where's the fun in that ? __eou__
We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? __eou__ Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . __eou__ But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... __eou__ It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... __eou__ How much do you think it would cost ? __eou__ Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . __eou__ $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__ It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . __eou__ Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . __eou__ No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . __eou__
Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? __eou__ China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation __eou__ We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable __eou__ Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent __eou__ Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? __eou__ It depends on how much you order __eou__ Can I use the FAS terms ? __eou__ I'd rather use the CIF terms.You ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract . __eou__
Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? __eou__ That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . __eou__ Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . __eou__ Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . __eou__ As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Carton ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . __eou__ Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . __eou__ All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . __eou__ You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? __eou__ That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . __eou__ Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . __eou__ No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? __eou__ Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . __eou__ Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . __eou__ Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . __eou__ Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . __eou__ Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . __eou__ Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . __eou__ Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . __eou__ That's fine too . __eou__
I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__ I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__ The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__ In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__ Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__ Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__ I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__ In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__ Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . __eou__
Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__ It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__ That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to withdraw some money . __eou__ Please fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw . __eou__ All right . And here's my bankbook . Is that all ? __eou__ Your ID card , please . __eou__ Oh , yes . Here it is . __eou__ Do you want large ones or small ones ? __eou__ Four in hundred , one in ten , please . __eou__ Wait a minute , please ... Here's the cash . __eou__ By the way , I'd like to change some U . S . dollars to pounds and I want to know today's exchange rate . __eou__ Well , sir . According to today's exchange rate , every pound in cash is equivalent to 1.89 U . S . dollars . How much would you like to change ? __eou__ I want 100 pounds . And here are 189 U . S . dollars . __eou__ ... OK . And here's your money . __eou__ Thank you . And goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Uh , yes . I'm going to the States and I need some traveler's checks . __eou__ All right . How much do you need ? __eou__ One thousand U . S . dollars . __eou__ One thousand U . S . Mm hmm . And are you going to pay cash ? __eou__ Oh , no . I want to withdraw from my U . S . dollars savings account . __eou__ All right . Now can I have your passbook ? __eou__ Right . Here it is . __eou__ Thank you . And what amounts do you want the checks in ? __eou__ Mm . In hundreds , please . __eou__
Is this the foreign exchange department ? __eou__ Yes , can I help you ? __eou__ I need some US Dollars . __eou__ What kind of currency have you got ? __eou__ RIB . By the way , what is the exchange rate today ? __eou__ One US Dollars in cash is equivalent t0 7.9 Yuan . __eou__ And I want to change 4000 Yuan . __eou__ Minus the fee . Here are your dollars . Please sign here . __eou__ OK , thank you . __eou__
Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? __eou__ I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
Good morning . How can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to open a new account . __eou__ Have you filled out an application form ? __eou__ Yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? __eou__ Yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? __eou__ Yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? __eou__ Yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . __eou__ That's very convenient . __eou__ It is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? __eou__ Yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? __eou__ The maximum is $ 1000 . __eou__ Is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? __eou__ Yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . __eou__ That's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? __eou__ They're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Miss Green , do you have life insurance right now ? __eou__ No , I don't . I don't have a family , so I don't think I need it . __eou__ This year our company is offering a new plan especially for single people like you . I think you might be interested . __eou__ Thank you , but I've never thought about it before . __eou__ It's OK . I'll leave the pamphlet here . If you need more information , you can call me any time . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Jones . __eou__ Hello , Miss Wu . __eou__ Long time no see . How is everything at home ? __eou__ Pretty good , thank you . And you ? __eou__ OK , thanks .

Jones . __eou__

Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? __eou__ Thank you . Here you are . __eou__ How do you want your money ? __eou__ Would you give me some in twenties and tens ? __eou__ All right . Please wait for a moment . __eou__

But I have to discuss it over with my boss before I make a decision . __eou__ OK . I hope you will be in touch with me shortly . __eou__
What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ Hmm , I want to change my traveler's cheque . Here is a traveler's cheque of 3,000 dollars . I would like to cash this cheque , please . __eou__ No problem .

A chequing or a savings account ? __eou__ What What features do they offer ? __eou__ Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars . __eou__ I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money . __eou__ Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . __eou__ No , that won ’ t be necessary . __eou__ In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork .

Would you like to make a deposit today ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars . __eou__

It should have four numbers . __eou__ Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . __eou__ You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . __eou__ OK , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen .

Well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__ For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__ Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__ That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__ That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__ I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! __eou__

I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? __eou__ Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . __eou__ And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? __eou__ Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . __eou__ Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__ As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__ That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . __eou__ It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . __eou__ So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . __eou__ Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . __eou__ You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . __eou__ No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . __eou__ In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . __eou__ I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . __eou__ Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . __eou__ I understand , Ma'am . __eou__ And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . __eou__ It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . __eou__ I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . __eou__ Well . __eou__ You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . __eou__ Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business . __eou__ Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible . __eou__
Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? __eou__ Yes . I've read it carefully . __eou__ And do you have any questions ? __eou__ No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? __eou__ No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . __eou__ But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . __eou__ I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? __eou__ Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? __eou__ I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . __eou__ I can accept that . __eou__ Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . __eou__ Even my health insurance ? __eou__ Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . __eou__ I have a few questions about the free membership . __eou__ What would you like to know ? __eou__ Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? __eou__ Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . __eou__ What are bar vouchers ? __eou__ Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . __eou__ But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . __eou__ That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . __eou__ So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? __eou__ Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . __eou__ I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . __eou__ I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . __eou__

Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c __eou__ What are you basing this information on ? __eou__ First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . __eou__ Yes , I will.We are very happy with your performance and want to continue our woodworking relationship . __eou__ I wish the same .

The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . __eou__ Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . __eou__ It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? __eou__ Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally __eou__ Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . __eou__ Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . __eou__ I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . __eou__ All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . __eou__
